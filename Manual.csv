2. Images of protesters shooting and killing soldiers would serve as propaganda against the actual cause of the protesters. The government and military would be looking at any way to turn public conscience against the protests, and labelling them as terrorists with picture and video evidence is the perfect way to do so.

 >Ad hominem (Latin for 'to the person'), short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments, some but not all of which are fallacious. Typically this term refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of ad hominem is ""A makes a claim x, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument x is wrong"".

South Africa is considered to be *developing.* It has aspects that are very developed, but large aspects which are not considered developed. You're listing a whole bunch of countries which are considered to be *developing*, not developed. The developed countries are high income. The *Western World* is generally considered to be North America, Europe and Australasia. Anyway, none of this matters, because no matter if we consider a comparison to the Western World, ""developed countries"" or ""high income countries,"" the result is the same. The US has the highest murder rate. By far. 

>Moreover, in regards to gun violence, nearly all of the violence takes place in a few select cities ‚Äî several of them having stringent gun laws. An oddity for sure if your underlying unstated hypothesis is correct.

No, it's certainly not true that ""nearly all"" of the violence takes place in a few select cities. In fact, *half* the violence happens in 127 cities, including the larger ones. The fact that they have stringent gun laws is irrelevant - the fact is that *all* of these illegal guns started life as legal guns, and were only manufactured because there is a huge market for them in a country awash in gun culture. All of the guns found in cities like NYC and Chicago were either bought in states with lax gun laws or they were stolen from irresponsible legal gun owners who didn't secure them adequately. They were then transported across state lines and sold in predominantly low income inner city areas, where they drive the murder rate. Besides which, Dallas has widespread legal gun ownership and its per capita murder rate is consistently four times that of NYC according to FBI figures. 

>And finally, there is quite a bit of data that indicates reducing gun laws and allowing concealed carry laws to be put in effect actually decreases murder and crime rates.

Again, tell that to Dallas with 4x the per capita murder rate of NYC despite widespread legal gun ownership. Denying the extent to which gun culture in the US drives its uncommonly high murder rate just sounds like insanity to sane, rational people.",lvvvm8,332,neutral
