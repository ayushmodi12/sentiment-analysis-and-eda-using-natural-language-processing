0,m94ryl,0,95,"Having to send your kids out there with no weapons knowing they r facing inhumane scums with guns and grenades, it‚Äôs literally is heart wrenching. Respect to those brave parents. Their sacrifice is unmeasurable."
1,m94ryl,5,25,Why didnt the us send their military to myanmar yet? Instead of sucking chinas dick all the time
2,m94ryl,7,5,Hoping the hostilities end soon. No parent should have to bear such a pain as the threat of your child being killed or taken captive in your own country everyday.
3,m94ryl,8,4,"These are brave people. Faced with same, I'm not sure I would be brave enough to try to fight."
4,m94ryl,11,3,Are we still arguing in America why the 2nd amendment matters?
5,m94ryl,16,2,And that‚Äôs why the people of every nation on the earth need firearms to help defat tyrannical governments
6,m94ryl,17,2,To bad they don‚Äôt have guns to fight the oppression
7,m94ryl,23,0,"Lambs to a slaughter. Sorry to say. You have evil dictators in power who have no empathy. Your sacrifice will be met with no emotion. It WILL all be in vain. Y'all need to seize their guns and use it against them. You can do it with the numbers. It won't be easy and most of you will die. But it will give the future of your children a chance. Without an uprising, the future will continue to be ruled by your leaders. And right now, they look worse than Chinese, North Korean and Islamic laws. I would give it a try if I had kids and my country was going through it. In fact, it is a duty to the human race to bring down tyrants. If you guys start small and fight smart, you have a much better chance. Plant the seeds of revolution so at least you could build a great army in the ling run. I worry for all you going through this. Good luck and please use your wits."
8,m94ryl,24,-10,"How about not going out there?

Like, how can you go out there knowing they will be gunning on you?

Damn, this is pure brave, I wouldn't be able to do so."
9,m94ryl,29,1,This is so sad :( as noble and admirable as this is it seems like for this specific situation they are getting killed for no reason. No amount of peaceful protest is going to change anything there
10,m94ryl,30,1,"When you protest, you don't do it for yourself or to gain anything that'll benefit you.  You do it for your children."
11,m94ryl,33,1,This is fucking heartbreaking. Best wishes to you all.
12,m94ryl,37,1,"AND THE LESSON OF THE DAY IS...

REPEAT AFTER ME EVERYONE ....

SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED !"
13,m94ryl,38,1,Dip your harrows in piss and shit and let them dry
14,m94ryl,43,1,"The US cannot benefit economically from Myanmar so why get involved. Also it‚Äôs an internal conflict, let their people work it out."
15,m94ryl,44,1,This is sad. Goodluck Myanmar and to the protestsrs
16,m94ryl,46,1,"I havent been to myanmar but have lived in cambodia and currently in vietnam. I dont believe people there want to be violent. Unless the people get weapons they cant win. I almost moved to Yangon for a job but stayed in Vietnam. Was thinking of what I would do if I was there. 

Move to prevent government for getting tax on my labor.

Go militian with people ( guessing that would get me killed fast)

Or get paid in cypto and pay in cypto.

I wouldnt care if price went up or down. We can have a payout for current rate and if it goes down ill take the lost. If up owner can pocket profit. As long as no money goes to taxes. I am not sure what crytpo would be best for this. Maybe just a stable coin to usd. 

I believe keeping econ going in small terms with people still farming and doimg small jobs while preventing any taxes to go to government will break them. The gangs that make money from collecting taxes cant pay wages if no taxes. The rest of the world needs to make sure all military, government members, and their family cant have money outside myanmar."
17,m94ryl,49,1,Why are you inactive?
18,m94ryl,52,-8,"2nd Amendment Why?  


Edit:   
A comment literally about what a shame it is that these protestors don't have the legal right to protect themselves with semi automatic firearms in response to open murder by government forces, and my comment about this being why we have the 2A gets downvoted? Keep your internet points and suck my dick, echo chamber."
19,m94ryl,53,-9,Why aren‚Äôt the parents going?
20,m94ryl,54,1,"this is why the 2nd amendment is the most important of all. it prevents any type of military coup and/or government tyranny.

which is funny because most redditors hate military coups, yet they also actively try to undermine the 2nd amendment.

it's almost as if most redditors are fucking stupid."
21,m94ryl,55,-1,They won't.
22,m94ryl,56,1,Idk but I kinda think Aung San Suu Kyi and the rest of the Myanmar majority shouldn‚Äôt have so vehemently supported the military when they were committing genocide on the Rohingya people...
23,m94ryl,59,1,How is Vietnam even comparable to what's happening here lol
24,m94ryl,61,29,"This isn't a fucking hollywood movie. Americans need to stop putting the US on that ''world savior'' pedestal. All their world prowess were always for personal profit or egoistic retribution.  


And even when it comes to this, The only military action they've done in the past decades were them couping countries and placing military forces in civilian territory to get favorable trade deals with the local industries.  


If the US were to send their military there, they'd expel the current coup and then place their own fascist pawn, just like they do with all these other countries."
25,m94ryl,62,16,World war 3
26,m94ryl,63,3,Because we've finally realized that we're really fantastically bad at that.
27,m94ryl,64,2,"we have a huge history of making things worse by sending in the military, so let's not go with that."
28,m94ryl,65,2,"Why didn‚Äôt Russia send their military when trump‚Äôs zombies stormed the capital? 

It‚Äôs an internal conflict that doesn‚Äôt effect us"
29,m94ryl,66,0,"They didn't when there was an active genocide against the Rohingya, why would they now."
30,m94ryl,67,1,World police
31,m94ryl,68,1,Because Hunter Biden‚Äôs Chinese handlers would get upset.
32,m94ryl,70,1,"Why would USA do this? It isn't USA job to interfere in another country's problems. IF, IF there is action to be taken in another country, it is not a monocratic decision taken by one country.
Stop thinking USA is the world savior, that's truth only in hollywood"
33,m94ryl,71,1,The US doesn‚Äôt have any economic interests in Myanmar so they really have no reason to intervene
34,m94ryl,72,1,Why the fuck can‚Äôt someone else police the worlds mess. There is other powers who have enough resources to deal with this. Send those gay hating racist British to fight this shit out
35,m94ryl,73,1,"how does us profit from that? exactly, not at all"
36,m94ryl,74,1,Maybe countries can handle their own problems and maybe the members of the coup are not the bad guys.
37,m94ryl,75,1,"don't take this the wrong way but, why havent you gone to help yet?"
38,m94ryl,76,1,Why should we send more of our youth to die for others freedom and then be hated for it?
39,m94ryl,77,1,Because Myanmar isn‚Äôt our problem
40,m94ryl,78,1,"Whenever the US gets involved, things get 10x worse."
41,m94ryl,79,1,If we sent our military they'd just end up under a pseudo non official military occupation until the end of time
42,m94ryl,80,28,"Easy for you to say, keyboard warrior."
43,m94ryl,81,20,With what? They have no access to weapons and limited materials to even come up with effective makeshift weapons.
44,m94ryl,82,2,That wouldn't turn out as well as you might hope. And it might do more harm than good.
45,m94ryl,83,2,Aite then keyboard warrior. As if you‚Äôd do the same in your country ü§£
46,m94ryl,84,1,"> show them that you wont stand for this and kill these bastards.

It's always Reddit keyboard warriors trying to get other people to lose their lives, jesus."
47,m94ryl,85,1,"This is a really ignorant comment, imo. You wanna go out there and die? You sure can talk big shit on the internet, but I somehow think if you were in this situation, you wouldn‚Äôt go at a fully equipped military with a few buddies and the weapons you scraped together."
48,m94ryl,86,1,It's the fucking military. They can firebomb your neighborhood with a plane. some people with ARs and trucks dont stand a chance when it's their own military.
49,m94ryl,88,1,This is one of the most ‚ÄúAmerican who will never do something like this in their life‚Äù things I‚Äôve ever read.
50,m94ryl,90,1,I wonder if people had this response 3 years ago when the same military group were committing genocide on the Rohingya's? Maybe this is what happens when you allow a vicious military group commit mass murder. They let the hounds loose on those innocent people and now they cry foul when it turns back to bite them.
51,m94ryl,98,2,Are you cheering for his death?!?
52,m94ryl,99,1,You really need to word better.
53,m94ryl,100,18,Because not going out is giving in to the terrorists. And that's worse than death for a lot of people
54,m94ryl,101,9,We can‚Äôt afford to let the unfair dictator win. Cuz it‚Äôs only gonna get downhill from that point if that happens.
55,m94ryl,103,1,"Phonebooks are useless as body armor with any of the ammo that the military uses.

Highly doubtful a phonebook can even stop a .22lr caliber.

Might as well be blessed in faith, then you dont have to carry around a phonebook and its the same results if you get shot."
56,m94ryl,104,1,"Also, if you show up to these and they see you're prepared to fight, chances are that they will be even more aggressive.
Remember, this isn't a BLM protest that might get out of hand, if they shoot to kill the government is literally by their side"
57,m94ryl,106,2,If I had to guess the OP may not be a native English speaker
58,m94ryl,107,1,"I downvoted because I tried to shit up, and it didn't work. Now there's a mess and my mom is crying."
59,m94ryl,110,1,"There's a lot of Burmese that doesn't. Me included. I'm still disappointed by Suu Kyi's comment at the UN meeting but I must also acknowledge that the NLD is largely powerless in the border zones where the genocide took place.

The best hope for the country, including for the Rohingya people, is to remove the military who have been doing all these killings and install a federal democracy that represents all ethnic people of Myanmar. That is our goal as the people of Myanmar."
60,m94ryl,111,1,Cunt
61,m94ryl,112,1,"You may very well be right, but I don‚Äôt think I could look at my kids face, not after refusing to try to save someone else‚Äôs kids who I was aware needed help. I am at the very least open to the idea of helping somehow."
62,m94ryl,115,1,"You guys should try and smuggle some guns in, tbh."
63,m94ryl,117,1,"I'm sorry, but your ""Dennis the menace"" comparison only works for the ones that are sold cheap at the store. It is extremely easy to build a VERY lethal, and orders of magnitude easier to learn to use / aim, (not to mention faster to fire) slingshot. One example here, but this guy's channel is full of them.  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVdq1Z5cSvA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVdq1Z5cSvA)"
64,m94ryl,118,11,"Even in cases like this, having citizens armed to the teeth doesnt help at all. Three reasons:

1. Even if each and every one of the protesters was armed with something, the outcome would be somewhere between the army absolutely outgunning them, or the entire country falling into civil war (which helps no one, and ends up in violent radicalisation and escalation on both sides).

2. Images of protesters shooting and killing soldiers would serve as propaganda against the actual cause of the protesters. The government and military would be looking at any way to turn public conscience against the protests, and labelling them as terrorists with picture and video evidence is the perfect way to do so.

3. Having a surplus of weapons in Myanmar led to the formation of multiple territory holding gangs and militias, each just as tyrannical as the military-government that the protests are fighting against. I don't think I need to explain how these are a bad thing."
65,m94ryl,119,3,"What are you talking about? 2A is American, and neither you, an Irishman by your own admission, nor the people that this post is about (people from Myanmar) are American, so how does 2A relate to this? I am le confused."
66,m94ryl,121,2,"On a per capita basis, the US probably lost more lives to the existence of the second amendment than the Junta has killed"
67,m94ryl,122,4,Fucking preach
68,m94ryl,123,1,"you realize that even if every citizen in America was armed that the government wanted would just send out drones and tanks.

I definitely believe in the second amendment right for home protection and protection against rapists and stuff but the idea that you can go up against an army is preposterous. 100 years ago it was possible but technology is such now that they would just send robots like why wouldn't they?"
69,m94ryl,124,0,You imbecile
70,m94ryl,125,9,They probably wouldn't last long
71,m94ryl,126,3,"Many adults are within the protest as well. Mothers and fathers have already been shot dead, leaving behind orphans.

If this lady is staying inside, I assume it's because having an empty house with no one in it is a bad idea in the middle of this situation."
72,m94ryl,127,3,I don't know first hand but perhaps the parents are old and thus cannot easily run away when the Junta forces start shooting LIVE ammunitions ie REAL bullets.
73,m94ryl,129,1,so they can make more children
74,m94ryl,130,1,Because a old woman doesn't have a chance against a armed soldier
75,m94ryl,131,3,Yup. The coup is backed by China and we all know the reputation of human rights by those scums.
76,m94ryl,134,1,No democracy in Vietnam yet.
77,m94ryl,135,1,No democracy.
78,m94ryl,136,1,Then why are you fighting for Democracy?
79,m94ryl,137,10,No reason for US to interfere. Myanmar already has a Rothschild bank and probably not enough oil.
80,m94ryl,139,10,"Yes but it would be Chinas fault if they started it because China wants to profit from Myanmar, their fucking interests are killing innocent good people..w... shame on all CCP, stay away from that crap nation. Someone has to stop slaughter"
81,m94ryl,140,2,"Yup, too many dicks slapping on tables right now. Myanmar people will fucked in the process.

I hope the people win this thing, and that it doesn't become a Hong Kong type situation by proxy."
82,m94ryl,142,1,I'm not smart enough to know how myanmar will lead us to it but you know how WWII was...
83,m94ryl,144,1,"Because these are not Muslims. Don‚Äôt you know, Muslims bad?"
84,m94ryl,148,5,It is very easy to pretend to be tough online and entirely harder to actually act on that.
85,m94ryl,149,0,"Right, this pussy would be pissing their pants if the cops knocked on the door let alone having to go fight a real army."
86,m94ryl,151,6,"Look what people did in Ukraine on maidan, they used anything"
87,m94ryl,154,1,They have a lot of weapons and the military is losing *hard*. At least according to my friend in Yangon.
88,m94ryl,156,1,"please use these https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/david-s-sling-14395020.jpg and stop using the dennis the menace sling shots they are useless compared to a sling. ditch the roman candles for truck tires that are stuffed with rags and diesel fuel and roll them down the street into their lines while raining down slugs from the sling. Even better melt some lead into oblong shapes with sharp ends. like the ones shown here https://youtu.be/2etapZX5k-Y?t=14 and when your out of that lead shot starting using stones. 100x more range and 100x more deadly then dennis the menace sling shots and marbles lol. Also arguably easier to make. The range alone compared to shitty marble is enough.

regular guy slinging 250 m https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs19_2tiSZw

you can drill holes in the shot to make them whistle and reduce their morale .. much scarier than silent ones and more likely to make the line break formation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXzuO1tU25I

is a sling as powerful as a gun? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BehBbNQRjXw"
89,m94ryl,157,3,Americans üôÑ
90,m94ryl,161,1,"I am not american, i am middle eastern. My country isnt full of pussies like your's is."
91,m94ryl,162,3,"Uh, idk if you‚Äôre American or not, but there were definitely protests from the 50s-70s, especially because of Vietnam War and then the civil rights movement."
92,m94ryl,163,1,We should privatize and deregulate everything
93,m94ryl,167,-3,"Exactly, just pray before you send your kids out to be slaughtered....cos you know, being dead is better apparently. I"
94,m94ryl,168,1,"Nothing is worse than death, death is the absolute end."
95,m94ryl,169,1,"I understand this is righteous.

But I can't imagine how brave they have to be, to protest in front of a gunpoint.

Keep hearing about the new that people got shot to death scares me."
96,m94ryl,176,2,"I'm ready to pull some shit off like that, but we're gonna need money and some way to transport the stuff a cross the pacific."
97,m94ryl,179,2,"The whole *point* is to start a civil war, so that would be a success.

The US military isn‚Äôt a single cohesive body, it‚Äôs made up of normal citizens of various political affiliations from all over. A serious national conflict would force each of them to actually pick a side instead of apathetically writing it off as ‚Äúpolice duty‚Äù. That‚Äôs precisely the point of said civil war.

 And if asked to fight a civil war against their own communities a large portion from every rank would immediately desert. They‚Äôd bring experience and weapons to the other side. State governments should organize or be replaced in the interim to reconstitute a federal government before any prolonged fighting began."
98,m94ryl,180,1,"Point number 1 in particular should be emphasized. People think armed citizens can stop a corrupt military? That‚Äôs insane. The military has bombs, fighter jets, Apache helis, attack drones, and all kinds of tech/ resources/ manpower that makes even an army of civilians with AR-15s and body armor almost completely obsolete."
99,m94ryl,181,0,"Armed insurrections are historically difficult to beat.  Just look at the what happened with the US and Vietnam.  The world‚Äôs hegemonic powerhouse got its ass handed to it by a bunch of farmers hanging out in the forest with foreign AKs.  And look at how long it took to take out Al-Qaeda to a substantial degree ‚Äî  pretty similar situation to Vietnam.  

The people of Myanmar don‚Äôt have fortresses and uniforms to allow for precision attacks.  They have homes in neighborhoods and along streets mixed and blended in their street clothes with other innocent civilians.  The military dropping bombs on entire neighborhoods like that would kill *maybe* one freedom fighter for every 200 women, children, and other non-combatants.  The government would have to be incredibly stupid **and** falsely believe they compete with the strongest countries militarily to do something so insane.

If the people were really so gung-ho about the coup, the wouldn‚Äôt be getting shot in the streets and asking for outside help and attention.  Innocent people don‚Äôt to be killed in the street, but they do deserve to be able to defend themselves from being murdered on cold blood, even if the military tries to spin it into propaganda.

Asserting that the people potentially being able defend themselves might make evil people do evil things and that‚Äôs a reason to keep them defenseless is asinine.  Evil people doing evil things is a reason **FOR** taking responsibility for your own safety, not against it.  

Your faulty logic makes you sound pro-tyranny.  You are spewing the propaganda you claim to fear."
100,m94ryl,183,1,You must not know how an insurgency works .. the Vietnamese had very crude weapons far less provisioned and we left because they simply wanted it worse
101,m94ryl,184,1,"He's saying this type of situation is the reason the right to bear arms should exist everywhere.

Just clearing it up, I personally don't agree with this."
102,m94ryl,185,1,"You're right, why try if it came to that? Just kneel. and then bob."
103,m94ryl,186,3,"Fucking preach!

America: where guns aren't used to fight the government, but for insane rates of suicide and homicide!"
104,m94ryl,187,3,"The idea of citizens being able to resist the government made a lot of sense when the nation was founded by people doing literally just that. Over time that idea along with many others became outdated and nonsensical, can't blame the founders for not being able to see how this would happen much more than you can blame them for not being able to predict the internet or something."
105,m94ryl,188,2,You're kidding right? You think 300 million armed people would lose? You don't understand how hard the people outnumber any instution even like the military.
106,m94ryl,189,1,"I don't agree with what you're saying sir, but I'd defend to the death your right to say it. Say, against a government shooting its own unarmed civilians."
107,m94ryl,194,1,"Yup, i‚Äôm one of those. Didn‚Äôt even know there‚Äôs a coup happening in Myanmar."
108,m94ryl,195,1,"I'm Vietnamese, and we don't want any of the bullshit US democracy so fuck off with that.

It was US craptier ""democracy"" that led Syria becoming shit, Iraq becoming shit, Ukraine mired in civil war, and we have to fight wars after wars just to have some moment of peace.

Just face the fact: the people of Vietnam has won the Vietnam-US war, and we will continue to support their own brand of democracy, a true revolutionary council socialist democracy, led by the people and for the people, despite how much effort both the US and China pouring in to destroy it. We have won our freedom, and we are intent to keep it.

I wish Myanmar people the best, but the notion that they shouldn't become Vietnam is absurd. They SHOULD become Vietnam, both the people and the leaders. Because that's the only road towards true freedom, without foreign intervention and shitstick tyrant stand in the way.

That said, the people should understand that they have to actually have something legitimate in order for other nation to help you guys. And this goes for both the people and the leaders of the NLD. Don't hide behind facebook post. Start organizing and banding together. Hinding in the woods and mountains if needed be. But you guys HAVE to build your own government and your own brand of democracy, not by voting, but by fighting. Or else if it's not the Chinese, then the US would take hold of your country like what they did in Thailand, Indonesia and Phillipines.

This is the lesson that we Vietnamese has been taught after years of fighting invaders and puppets. It's either our way or no way when it comes to running our own country. And that attitude should be what you guys need."
109,m94ryl,196,1,"I would rather live in Vi√™t Nam than Myanmar before the protests

I would rather live in Vi√™t Nam than every mainland African country, even the ones with democracy.

Only Mo√ßambique, Botswana, and Zambia in mainland Africa are somewhat decent right now for the average people, and Vi√™t Nam being undemocratic is still miles ahead of them.

I wish Myanmar would be like Vi√™t Nam

Vi√™t Nam still has some huge problems, but jeez"
110,m94ryl,197,1,"China‚Äôs military‚Äôs only recent action was a scuffle between them and India‚Äôs mountain troops. Other than that, all Chinese military has done is beat up on Monks and civilians. You clearly have overestimated China‚Äôs warring capability."
111,m94ryl,198,5,"I think US understands, and the world understands that China would be to blame. But the US certainly isn't willing to lose millions of people and kill tens of millions unless they absolutely have to. I stand with Myanmar. I'm sickened, too, and am pro-intervention on this issue.

The Trumpers WANT a Myanmar style coup."
117,m94ryl,205,14,Is he wrong though? Nobody said it will be easy but it needs to be done.
118,m94ryl,206,0,And you have guns fucking dipshit
119,m94ryl,207,1,"Shit, they made make shift bows in Hong Kong."
120,m94ryl,209,2,The Junta is ruthless.  They may force people to work.
121,m94ryl,210,1,"That's what we trying at the moment and the strike is going strong. However, the consequence of not working is years of jail time which you would be abused and maybe even raped."
122,m94ryl,211,2,"That still doesn't help if they are mostly military bootlickers, which isn't unlikely."
123,m94ryl,212,1,"I‚Äôd love to know where you got that from, because its about as wrong as you can get. 

Myanmar is 179th in the world with 1.6 guns per 100 people. That is next to nothing and nowhere near enough to effectively use them against the military."
124,m94ryl,213,1,That‚Äôs more to do with the number of ‚Äòcivilian‚Äô warlord factions in more remote areas. Myanmar has a difficult history
125,m94ryl,214,1,"Yeah but most of the guns are with the extended family of the military. It's mostly spoiled little brats who get an AR just because his daddy's a general. Even if we did have access to guns, the vast majority of the population lives in poverty and wouldn't be able to afford said weapons."

127,m94ryl,216,1,"I am egyptian, please do not presume stupid shit, not everyone on the internet is american."
128,m94ryl,217,1,No we probably wouldn‚Äôt. We have the largest and arguably most deadly military on Earth. If they actually saw any civilians as a threat they could just bomb the entire neighborhood/city or come through in unmarked vehicles and individually kidnap/murder whoever they wanted. We would be fucked.
129,m94ryl,220,3,"I'd rather be dead fighting if it means that people in my country don't become pawns under a fascist regime. You don't have to do it, it's understandable that some people are selfish and value their lives over others, that's why there is people who are ready to give theirs these people still have rights, respect these people."
130,m94ryl,221,1,"This is a very self-entitled thing to say. You seem like someone who's lived a simple life, not knowing what it means to fight for your freedom, not knowing what it means to be enslaved to a dictatorship, to not have a voice or freedom of speech. There are people who prefer living in silence, to give in for their most basic rights. And there the ones who change the world."

133,m94ryl,228,1,"Well yes, but really no. Of course you want the citizens to be able to have some authority within their communities, but its simply not a realistic manner of doing so.

 First of all, this is about Myanmar, not the US per se. Sure, their military may be weaker than the US', but so is their social and political infrastructure. Even *if* they managed to get on track to overthrowing the military government via citizen coup, one of the nearby militia's would jump at the oppourtunity to take power. You'd simply be replacing one form of oppressive government with another.

And secondly, you vastly underestimate the effect that disinformation or ""bad actors"" can have during modern conflicts. Just look at everything that happened during last year's BLM movements in the US. Maybe some of the violence was ""faked"" or initiated by police instead of those protesting. Maybe none of it was. Maybe all of it was. The fact that theres any debate at all has created a divide. Now imagine that, but instead with images of citizens shooting and killing law enforcement/military officials. Its easy to imagine people rallying for the cause rather than against it if it's a cause yoy support, but nothing is ever that politically clear cut and predictable.

Also, the wrath of social issues from increased suicides, homicides, shootings, rampancy of gangs, etc due to high rates of gun (especially full-auto) ownership simply isn't worth a ""maybe"" scenario that doesn't even work out."
134,m94ryl,229,4,"The point isn‚Äôt to win an actual offensive against the US military, it‚Äôs to force an actual conflict with heavy casualties and make members of the armed forces confront the decision of putting their lives at risk to murder their fellow citizens. Instead of just them showing up with a gun looking menacing as heavy-handed ‚Äúpolice‚Äù.

Then you get desertions and a civil war."
135,m94ryl,230,3,Reminds me of what happened in Desert Storm the Iraqi army was so completely outgunned that it was one of the most absurdly one sided wars in history. They got absolutely and utterly steamrolled and they were still a legitimate army with actual organization as opposed a random group of citizens with rifles. What kind of heat do people imagine people are packing that they could deal with a modern army taking things seriously? It would have to be the actual libertarian meme of owning your own ICBMs or something absurd.
136,m94ryl,231,1,"Rebellion doesn't happen through normal ground war, it happens through guerilla warfare. Assassinations, bombings, etc. You don't need to hold territory, you need to cut off the head of the snake. If a large portion of the populace is armed, these things are much easier and harder to defend against, even by an advanced military. The government isn't going to bomb large population centers in their own country. ""Fighter jets and apache helis"" aren't going to be much use either."
137,m94ryl,232,0,"""If the people really were so gung-ho about the coup they wouldn't be getting shot"" uhhhh what? Could you elaborate on your point here?

Also, they have backing from China's military if the situation escalates further. So, they really could compete with the best of the world's militaries. Of course I'm not saying to give up and give in to oppressive powers. Fuck that. But if the people really want the problem to be solved in the long term, they have to continue what they are doing so that other nations realise that siding with them is the right thing to do, just as many countries already have. See, Canadian sanctions on China concerning this situation and their genocide of the Uyghur people. Meeting violence with violence will do more harm than good long term, as it suddenly becomes less politically clear cut and transitions into two factions fighting for power (in terms of how it must be percieved by foreign governments).

And as someone who doesn't live in the US, I can completely testify that a lack of widespread gun ownership does in fact mean less violent crime. There are bad people everywhere, but guns do nothing but escalate the manner in which these actions manifest. But really, this is almost besides the point here."
138,m94ryl,233,3,LOL ‚Äúthey simply wanted it worse‚Äù?? You know nothing about the Vietnam War do you?
139,m94ryl,234,2,"An offensive front in a foreign land with little knowledge or preperation of the local terrain works much differently to a nation's entire military with full control over electricity, transport, etc.

159,m94ryl,268,1,"You cut off my sentence and changed the context.  This post is an example of what I‚Äôm talking about.  The entire situation in Myanmar that‚Äôs putting Myanmar at the forefront of people‚Äôs thoughts around the world is what I‚Äôm commenting on.

I need to be fast, so I‚Äôm going to bullet point this (pun not intended):

1) If you really believe (and if there‚Äôs evidence to support) that the military is going to start bombing their hundreds of their own countrymen in order to maybe perhaps kill a single protester, then that‚Äôs another argument for allowing anyone willing to take up arms.  The military is already escalating against a people that are wholly defenseless.  I‚Äôve seen people telling them to rig up slingshots with rubber gloves and soda bottles and sticks and string to fight back because they‚Äôre so desperate.  Holding out hope that evil men will show the defenseless people they‚Äôre murdering a bit of good will out of the blue is a fool‚Äôs errand.

2) Canada‚Äôs sanctions on China have no bearing on what‚Äôs going on in Myanmar unless you know something I don‚Äôt.  I‚Äôd love it if you could find me one local that‚Äôs praising God that Canada is imposing economic sanctions after finding out their loved ones were murdered, because that would at least show they‚Äôre somewhat hopeful during a seemingly hopeless situation.

3) To reiterate:  Sure, fighting back will lead to harm, but doing nothing is already leading to harm.  At least if the willing are capable of fighting back, the military will slow their roll and rethink their strategy.  Even evil men want to live to see another day.

4) People being defenseless doesn‚Äôt mean less violent crime.  Fewer guns means less gun-related deaths and injuries, but it also means the weakest among us are less capable from defending themselves against motivated criminals.  Once you account for crimes in a small handful of densely populated US cities, general violent crime rates plummet substantially.  What‚Äôs most notable, though, is that even by the Brady Campaign‚Äôs stats (one of the most fervent anti-gun lobby groups in the US), people successfully defend themselves with firearms over 6.5x more often than people are killed in gun-related homicides every year.  Even when you throw in all gun-related deaths ‚Äî homicides, suicides, accidents, and negligent discharges ‚Äî the number of successful defense scenarios is still more than 2.5x higher annually.  Firearms give the weakest among us a chance to survive violent crimes should they choose to do so, from the elderly to the physically weak(er), disabled, and mobility impaired.  

Like you said, there are evil people all over the world.  And evil people have been maiming, raping, murdering, and imposing tyranny since before firearms were even a concept.  That‚Äôs all good reason in favor of allowing anyone that‚Äôs willing to be able to defend themselves, their families, and even their country, with the best defensive tools available.  

Evil people doing evil things is never a valid argument against self-defense."
160,m94ryl,269,2,Hell yes .. anyone that literally digs a nest of underground caves and mantraps stretching 50 miles inside of jungle wants it worse .. we will see who wins .. the Myanmar people have a fairly good chance here if the Chinese do not directly intervene

It's either our way or no way when it comes to running our own country. And it's either their way or no way when it comes to running their country. 

The western ""democracy"" (if you could even called it that) has already failed most Western people, and Covid 19 simply exposed that. So why should we follow it? Because some dipshit thinks that Vietnamese, whose beating every fucking assholes in the 20th century for our freedom, survive through US economic sanctions and now is one of the fastest (if not the fastest) rising economy while actually lifted everybody out of poverty AND having full free speech, becoming a regional powers in South East Asia and can actually said ""Fuck you"" towards both the US and Chinese without fearing them is ""no freedom""?

You should detoxify yourself out of US propaganda by reading some Ho Chi Minh thoughts first. I don't give a shit if you think that I'm wrong, but Western ""democracy"" DOES NOT WORK. It's full of demagogues and corporate corruptions, and just power infighting after power infighting after power infighting after power infighting so that nothing gets done, or even worse, corporations rewriting laws and regulations in order for them to strangle small businesses, bust unions, wages wars and cut social security fundings to the point of irrelevance. It's already happened in the US, UK, France, Spain, Greece, Germany, Italy, Thailand, Phillipines, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and even Sweden, and it will happened to the rest.

Okay, assuming you like those concepts, given the last decade of behaviors by China and Russia, what do you think would cause them to stop acting in the way they act today? If you believe that war is an eventuality, then it becomes an objective truth that war today under any circumstances hold less potential for destruction than tomorrow. Correct? So I agree with your statement, but I'm more receptive to alternative solutions <3

Considering most of those are most likely smaller arms for the most part, and that the military has way more than just guns at their disposal no, thats not enough to take on the military beyond throwing your lives away.

Also that list is ranking per capita, so its odd that you decided to rerank them yourself based on total number of guns, which would skew heavily towards larger countries. Per capita is a much better indicator, so no, one gun per 50 people about is not enough to take on a military.

203,m94ryl,331,2,"The issue with that is multifaceted. Obviously that is a good policy to implement, imo, but let me point out the potential pitfalls. 

1. Timetable - the time it would take to move manufacturing and investment would take significant amounts of time, also China is America's number one investor and holds the single largest foreign share of our national debt.

2. Prices - Americans by in large despite disliking China aren't prepared or willing to pay higher prices for everyday goods. As proven with the mask shortage during the early days of the pandemic, America is as incapable sometimes as producing goods adequately in a service-based economy as some of our citizens would be to afford the higher prices.

2a) No politician wants to be responsible for that decline in real wages/quality of living in America.

3) Historical context - China's push to modernize is a complex and moving situation, but it began as an idea that they would redeem themselves for the century of shame by around 2050 (100 years after the founding of the PRC). So if we remove their economic means, they might transition toward a more violent approach. So this strategy could potentially accelerate a WW3.

4) Foreign powers - American trade policy with regard to China is one thing, but other nations, even allied nations may not be nearly as willing to endure similar economic hardship for the sake of weakening China and other states may fill the gap that we leave behind."

Or in this case the protestors?"
211,m94ryl,347,1,"Lmao, okay I've got time for this one. Assault Rifle is literally defined as ""a rapid fire, magazine fed AUTOMATIC Rifle designed for infantry use."" The semi-automatic rifles I own do not qualify just because they're the same shape and magazine fed. You can see my AK in my post history. Scary looking enough to be assault-y? You are quite literally ignorant and proving my point."
212,m94ryl,348,-1,Shut the fuck up you fucking children would you go fight for your country no because your a fucking cunt
213,m94ryl,349,0,"I agree with all your statements but there seems to be a variable in our statements that match with what's being stated in the picture about.  Either we fight now or let them take over completely.  We can't sit idle and do nothing.  The smaller countries are the beginning.  They wont stop there, CCP is the new Nazi's imo"
214,m94ryl,350,1,"""we still don't do anything."" - We let them into the country to get them away from predators on the other side of the Mexican border where they were forced to camp. Biden's only mistake is that we didn't have enough housing prepared. Which was a mistake, but FEMA, DHS, and state agencies in my state are housing these kids in places like the Dallas Convention Center. So we're not doing nothing. You're dead wrong about that. Being in limbo in the US is better than being in limbo on the opposite side of the border with the cartel. Idk if you spend all day reading Chinese propo or if you're just a single world govt commie. Either way, you're so indoctrinated you can't see the forest for the trees."
215,m94ryl,351,1,What pussy power does these days
216,m94ryl,352,1,"I need a citation for this: ""US policy has resulted in the deaths of millions of civilians in the last decade and this is not an understatement.""
-Also such a statement/proof is only appropriate where no other state's policy had a hand in causing said deaths. Good luck.

""Look at the extent of tyranny currently happening in our own govt with the military industrial complex and the prison industrial complex."" - I don't think you know what tyranny means. Those issues are with corruption.

""Nice CIA propaganda you‚Äôre repeating."" - Gonna need proof for this. The CIA would have to be writing articles for like 20+ publications across like 5+ countries. 

""The world already sucks with US in charge"" - But homosexuality is legal here unlike Russia, and you don't go to prison for criticizing the govt or the dear leader like in China. So 'sucking' is on a scale. Let's continue.

""We are doing way worse stuff than China so I have no idea why you think ‚Äúhumankind could be at stake‚Äù.  - they are currently undertaking a genocide as we speak. I can't even relate to a statement this stupid.

""Literally all the anti China stuff comes from the CIA because they want people to be okay with rising aggressions with them, and polls show majority of Americans now think China is our biggest threat. Also half our navy is in the South China Sea already so there‚Äôs that."" - 100% false. Satellite images of genocide camps, military build up in Pacific attempting to claim waterways that at least half the planet uses for shipping. National waterway rights end 12miles from their shore. No where else on earth can a nation claim half of the largest ocean on earth. DUMB! 

People are scared of China because we should be. They harass our ships on freedom of navigation tours, they do anal swab tests on Western diplomats to insult us, they are the second largest economy, they are engaging in debt-lock diplomacy in Africa, they steal intellectual property from every other nation on Earth. Maybe the CIA is running Sweden's govt, too? Since their internal rapport just said that China uses students and journalistic cover to steal intellectual property. Which contributes to their meteoric rise to be competitive on the world stage. Half of our navy is smaller than half of their navy. So not one FUCKING word of what you said is true. NOT ONE FUCKING WORD!"
217,m94ryl,354,1,"It's also worth noting that the distinction of 'army' is also a bit dated. Most warfare is cyber, or unmanned, or extremely precise or supported by all kinds of hardware. If this were strictly an 'army' conflict, we'd be fucked because the Chinese soldiers outnumber us 10 to 1."
218,m94ryl,356,1,"""...someone's personal beliefs cannot be different than those of their country"".

I don't agree with this statement so I don't reconcile it with any of my other beliefs or statements."
219,m94ryl,357,1,"And it will only get more widespread once they take up arms. Short of an actual western intervention, there is no hope, sadly.

Edit:

The only hope they have is continued peaceful protest leading to a ""coup within the coup"" or ""western intervention"" in some forms.

Like I already sad, there are very few outcomes here that'll end well."
220,m94ryl,359,1,"You are right, US have no ties with Myanmar, therefore US has very little stake in Myanmar & therefore not much influence (in terms of economy, currency etc) & thus can‚Äôt make the military listen to US. 
And I am afraid US army may not be very good at land fight, especially in the wood( Vietnam war). So there‚Äôs not much US can do. And obviously now TW is much more important in many aspects and TW is also in great danger. US may not wanna spread out too thin. So probably such Air Force military actions might be the most efficient one."
221,m94ryl,360,1,"They really dont.  The forces in the middle east use Russian gear that's basically indestructible, and they lose every stand up fight they have with US forces.  They're ""holding out"" because the US isnt intending to beat them, only to occupy the region for corporate gain"
222,m94ryl,361,1,"Those same fat slobs stopped the Redcoats and sent them home long ago .. if you try to take away American's guns it won't just be ""old fat people"" who will be angry"
223,m94ryl,363,1,"Cunts, everyone."
224,m94ryl,364,1,This is the inconvenient truth as I see it.
225,m94ryl,365,1,Yep. Giving a mouse a cookie doesn‚Äôt make them go away. We have been down this road before.
226,m94ryl,366,1,"Those ‚Äúpredators‚Äù are a product of the war on drugs that we started and the current admin upholds. Also not to mention the countless coups during the Cold War which led to civil war all over Central America. How dense are you? Also, love how you focused on the last sentence of what I said which wasn‚Äôt even the point. And the Dallas convention center is the best thing they could do? Great fucking job but that‚Äôs literally helping 1 percent of the problem"
227,m94ryl,369,1,not necessarily. the chinese would lose the air war instantly and we all know the US military loves to bomb the ever loving fuck out of its enemy
228,m94ryl,370,1,mmk. That's ominous. :P
229,m94ryl,371,1,"You gave someone shit when they stated their personal belief. Your whole spiel was about how could they reconcile their beliefs when compared to an entire country. 


I asked you how you could not reconcile that nationalism and personal beliefs are not always the same. 


Could also ask why you assume the other commenter meant US troop involvement when they said they are pro-intervention. Plenty of other options for intervention short of a US military invasion. 


You keep bringing up US military involvement  when replying to people who said nothing about US military involvement.

Edit: removed an incorrect sentence"
230,m94ryl,372,-1,"Oh well don't get your hopes up for Western Intervention then, they'll either support the military or some other random fascist (you know, cause of their long history of supporting fascists lol)"
231,m94ryl,373,1,"Again im not saying the US should intervene or could do well. Im more saying a militia force of civilians do insurgency shit to make the military‚Äôs life a living hell. 

Thats how the Taliban has been holding strong against the US for 20 years.

Make it impossible to tell who is an enemy combatant and who is a civilian."
232,m94ryl,375,1,"Uh,  the American Revolution had plenty of help from the French. Even back then the war was not won through civilian with gun. You are also forgetting the technology gap.  This isn't 1700 anymore, and You are contradicting your self, you litterally just admitted it that the NVA couldn't have won, yet somehow you believe the modern American civilian is going to be able to win any war or rebellion against the US  government? The only way for anyone to win today is receiving support from another state but that ain't happening."
233,m94ryl,376,1,"Alright since we're just straight up being rude, you're being a bitch about terminology knowing full well the government uses the terms interchangeably when it discusses confiscation and control? The general public doesn't differentiate and I thought you were part of that populace. My mistake. That said, you sound like a fucking Fudd. You're either gonna give those guns up if asked or not, and I'm betting you're the former. Let me know how that works for you man."
234,m94ryl,378,1,"You all make good points, the CCP is evil and needs to be taken out. It‚Äôs not gonna be an easy task, whether by law or by force. Nevertheless, the CCP will succeed as long as good people remain inactive."
235,m94ryl,379,1,"Okay so do the sources of the predators from 40 years of policy somehow change the fact that they were there preying on these migrants? 

Glad you admitted that much. 

I made no claims about the causes of the cartels. You made a claim that the US does nothing to help. You‚Äôre wrong. I showed that. Enjoy eating your words. Please use a reusable fork."
236,m94ryl,383,1,"They have to have something in hand to start with first. Now it‚Äôs late and difficult to train the ppl. In fact I think the US should intervene - maintain law and order. If they wanna promote democracy then at the same time they also need to protect democracy. Otherwise Myanmar will just turn into something like North Korean, probably not as bad as that, but won‚Äôt be anything like Vietnam or South Korea. So probably beheading action may be the best option for US if they wanna help Myanmar ppl."
237,m94ryl,384,1,"Focus on your original point ..

> Lol you truly didn't know how insurgency in Vietnam worked, they didn't have very crude weapons, the viet cong was supplied by the Soviet and Chinese and is an auxiliary force to the NVA (regularly North. Vietnamese army). They are not some rag tag group of teenagers

The point of insurgency is not to ""win"" in the classical sense just to drag shit out forever and make it so expensive that the other side decided ""this is not worth it .. I am done"" .. comparing the Vietnamese to the US armed forces was naive .. and no we would not have ""won Vietnam"" unless we went medieval and killed everything .. Americans usually do not do that (except those 2 times)"
238,m94ryl,385,0,"My providing evidence to prove you are being ignorant was being rude but you baseless calling me Ignorant wasn't? Work on self reflection kid. Your point was that people call your assault weapons assault weapons so they don't know what they are talking about, you're a larper. And handing guns in? Your funny. It would take the US military marching on my reservation to make my people disarm. And it wouldn't be the first time they marched on us."
239,m94ryl,388,1,"Ok my bad. I was wrong that they are doing nothing. They are doing barley anything. Great job. I also love how you cry like a bitch about China giving our diplomats anal swabs but don‚Äôt seem to have a problem with the war on drugs, the nsa, funding a genocide in Yemen. You sound like a classic imperialist"
240,m94ryl,389,1,"It's not easy to say, but we're not at the point of civilization yet where human rights is that high up on the list of things that spur action that supersedes traditional political relationships. Rwanda, Cambodia, Germany, and many more.  Politically I don't see the US or China influencing what happens in Myanmar that much. [Sanctions won't be effective here](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/04/what-america-should-and-shouldnt-do-about-myanmars-coup/) but it'll be one of the only things the US has to do to look good. China's not necessarily a buddy for them because who wants to be a pawn? I think we'll see a North Korea situation here (lots of talk, civilians suffering, but nothing big happens) but you never know."
241,m94ryl,392,1,"I mean honestly, the Taliban hasn‚Äôt had anything but goat herder‚Äôs and it‚Äôs ranks for the past 15 years. Majority of the leader ship has been killed by the US, and most of the troops as well. If we really look at it, it‚Äôs mostly random farmers in a blood feud with United States"
242,m94ryl,393,1,"And how exactly does that relate to civilian gun ownership in peace time? Almost every single example you can find in modern battlefield about insurgency is that place has been fighting for a long time and so weapons are everywhere already. If you want an insurgency, civilians with weapons before the war is not a needed pre requisite. Because by the time your country melted into a war zone weapons are already everywhere be it supplied from foreign sources or released from armoury or government depo."
243,m94ryl,394,1,Lmao I'm a larper. You're focusing on arbitrary terms and not actuality. How far we've come. I wish you and yours good fortune in the wars to come.
244,m94ryl,396,1,"That's my point bro. It's disingenuous to make a statement about America's success ""against another nation's army"" because that type of warfare doesnt really exist in that form any more. If you're considering an 'army' to be identical to a 'military' then yeah you're dead on. I am not equating army to military. I'm equating 'army' to 'infantry' or land unit v land unit combat. Thanks sarge!"
245,m94ryl,397,1,"""But I think you have a...warped view on the concept of national sovereignty. It is my opinion that sovereignty is forfeit when the human rights of your people are widely infringed upon and especially when a genocide is undertaken.""

Hehehe. You know that human rights are defined at the National level right, not international. Sovreignty doesn't care what you think and imposing your nation's values on another breaks the notion of sovereignty."
246,m94ryl,398,1,"However the Taliban is on their land, they can train their members on their land with weapons bought from somewhere easily. They can disguise themselves easily, too. Now for US for whichever other countries, they may ship weapons to Myanmar ppl, but then training doesn‚Äôt exist. And there‚Äôs also one thing, the majority of Myanmar ppl are Buddhists...
Unless they train some ppl and send them back to Myanmar, then the Taliban like situation may happen. And this takes time as well. So IMO stirke + be heading actions + (maybe burn down Chinese factories)

And if countries just give weapons to some ppl, who knows if they will become another military gov or not. If they wanna train some of the Myanmar ppl, they also need these ppl to be recognized by ASSK, no matter what the free world thinks of this lady, Myanmar ppl love her. Then this will be like helping Myanmar to set up another gov to replace the current one. Or more precisely, set up another troop to replace the current one. 

Myanmar is not very important to China, but it means something to China. China imports food and Jade and rare-earth elements from it. I heard that it has a large amount of a particular type of rare-earth element which elsewhere have little."
247,m94ryl,403,1,"Now show me the membership list and minus that number from 195. That's how many countries aren't interested.

Edit: Lol the number is like 2. I'll update my statement to, show me how many times the UN has been successful with their peacekeeping, whose armies they used to do it and why any neighbouring countries or nearby factions won't take issue to it. I'll of course be researching my own answers too."
248,m94ryl,404,1,"There are many nations whose sovereignty I reject even while recognizing their govnernments' temporary legitimacy at ruling their states. I just believe they no longer have the right to do so in perpetuity and so long as these violations are ongoing, their sovereignty is forfeit. They are not fulfilling their agreements under the UN declaration of human rights and therefore their sovereignty as defined by the UN should no longer be guaranteed? It seems pretty coherent to me."
249,m94ryl,407,1,"No. I don't think I will. I've explained my position. Your argument seems to be ""yeah well who cares?"""
250,m94ryl,408,1,So when is UN going to invade China?
251,m94ryl,411,1,"So in terms of what we should do in the real world, it shouldn't include US physical intervention based on a realistic assessment of net consequence considering the US's track record.

""No nations give a shit about other nation's human rights issues unless there's a personal interest"" If you think the UN should uphold their agreements, you're also asking for the US to turn up in Hong Kong and Crimea soon after Myanmar."
252,lwpl71,0,99,Tf??? We need to find all the companies that do business with the military and do a hardcore global ban! Us there a list of those businesses somewhere?
253,lwpl71,1,150,This is a LOT worse than HK but why people are not paying that much attention???
254,lwpl71,2,39,"Pardon me for saying something stupid, but i think your ‚Äúpeaceful protest‚Äù are not gonna work.

You need support from military and police (A LOT of them) that willingly support your movement in order to ease your peaceful protest.

Indonesia has same problem in 1998. Suharto‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù regime (Orde Baru) are behaving the same way like your military and police do (they shot and killed 4 students at May 12, 1998 protest and probably staged mass riot in Jakarta that kill a lot of civvies). 9 day after that incident, Suharto finally resigned after getting pressure from some high ranking military officer that demands his resignation. Thus ending the 32 year ‚ÄúNew Order‚Äù regime.

If you don‚Äôt have support from some military and  police, i‚Äôm afraid that armed resistance is the only way to get rid of that regime. Because right now the world clearly doesn‚Äôt care about your plight (they‚Äôre more care to HK protest than yours)"

They're like a whole different caste and has their own gated community, their own schools,their own banks, their own media. 
These military generals will not give up their power easily. And the Myanmar military will do anything to hold onto power as seen in previous uprising. For example, the 1988 uprising where thousands of students were gunned down. In fact, it was so bad to this day we do not know the exact number of deaths since the military would chop up the corspe and toss them into the rivers to erase ""evidence"". Alot of sons and daughters left that day and never returned.

Well, the Indonesian National Revolution cost a lower estimate of around 97,000 deaths.

Armed resistance are very costly. You can check out the aftermaths of Grozny, Damascus, Mosul, and Marawi to see the likely results of battles involving those cities. Cities are leveled, people are made homeless, and supply chains disrupted (leading to starvation, food insecurity, malnutrition, cholera and similar diarrhea diseases). Hundreds of thousands will die.

Will it be worth it? People are screaming ""save Myanmar"" when 150+ die. Guess what happen when hundreds of thousands die and millions turning into refugees."

Oh, and don't worry; they just didn't take the car keys and supplies of that ambulance, they also steal and rob everything they can, in addition to billions of money, the governance power and tens of lives.

Apparently, these police officers were given no meals by their overlords and that's why they have been stealing food. Basically, they're being worked without any food. They beg for food from protesters then beat them up shortly afterwards without a shred of mercy when the ""order"" comes. They were intentionally left hungry to cloudy their judgement and make them angry.

They cover license plates and reuse these seized civilian vehicles to disrupt protests since protesters could see them from far away and brace themselves for the raid. They drive close to the protest site, then get out, shoot at the protesters in an Al Qaeda style at close range, drag everyone in and drive away.

He said pretty much the west has sanctioned Myanmar for a long time over the military regime, so instead they are taking bad deals with China who hasn't sanctioned them. They are becoming more and more reliant, taking out bad deals cuz that's all they can get. I know it was only one sentence of your comment though I feel even western sanctions cannot do much cuz we have sanctioned them for a long time now and they doubled down and rely on china instead"
476,lwpl71,318,6,"Well, Indonesia tried to help, only to get pressured and 'shamed' on. The masses are (understandably) too emotional to do negotiation and making rational decisions.

Myanmar is mimicking HK and other milk tea protest, but with how it's going on right now, I really don't see any way out considering that even HK with its incredibly organized protestors and massive international pressure still lost. 

Hopefully I'm wrong here and you guys will get the best results."

Yes, they are. I'm saying this, because otherwise it could take credibility from them of what they are doing.

They deliberatly choose to behave like fucking monsters and should be held accountable for their attrocities.

Do you even know what people did in response to those riots? They went out and bought firearms to protect themselves. Millions of ‚Äúanti-gun‚Äù people purchased firearms because they finally understand firsthand that the police are not there to protect them. That they are responsible for their own safety."

490,lwpl71,336,1,"As they do every where.

You are taking my comment out of context. What‚Äôs happening in Myanmar is a violent coup with country wide violent government oppression of its citizens by force/violence.

510,lwpl71,365,1,Obviously you don't read r/bad_cop_no_donut. Because there have been quite a few videos posted there
511,lwpl71,366,2,"There was actually quite a few articles about nurses, doctors and EMS in state approved medical staging areas being subject to assault in various degrees i.e. getting shot with rubber rounds because they were helping (providing medical attention to) injured protesters.  There was also medics getting hit with rubber rounds because they were simply in the way, I think the firefighter he's referencing was an on duty fireman who was profiled and 2 LEOS popped out of their vehicle guns drawn because of him fitting the description of a black male who was supposedly armed despite being in turnout gear on company property.  Then there was the police destroying water/medical supplies and spraying them with tear gas and other chemicals which per the Geneva convention qualifies as a war crime, but I guess it's ok when done against the citizens?  

There was a lot of it around and it wasn't too hard to find, we shouldn't get rid of police but the ingrained/trained hostility needs to be bred out. They do need reform, that being said I don't think anything will be done until people are willing to sit down and discuss it instead of shouting and pointing fingers."

518,lwpl71,378,2,It‚Äôs all about expectations... nobody had high hopes for Burma.
519,lwpl71,379,2,It's literally illegal to protest in HK now so what exactly are you waiting for reddit to do for Myanmar that they couldn't do for HK?
520,lwpl71,380,4,Bro hk may have made it to the top but that's not going to do anything. The only way they can fight this Injustice is to fight back with guns. Peaceful protest hasn't been a useful tactic for a long time. This is just my opinion but I don't think Martin Luther King's peaceful protest was the whole reason why they got the rights they did. I'm pretty sure Malcolm x Black Panthers definitely helpped push that motive.

>Well, Indonesia tried to help, only to get pressured and 'shamed' on. 

I'd agree with you if what they did was not trying to make the military hold its word of holding elections within one year, which the military has a history of never honouring its own promises (see 1990 elections of Myanmar, where the junta jailed all members of the winning party) or the federalism promised for the ethnics during the independence movement from British, or allow the military to officially hold onto power during that one year after the entire world has been rejecting its legitimacy and repeatedly condemned the junta."

544,lwpl71,408,6,"From my understanding and research, a military coup took place to out the democratic group that was elected in by the people. From what I heard, the reasoning was that there was election fraud, but others say its a power grab. Either way, the citizens are rightfully pissed and protesting heavily because apparently, the people gained a lot of freedom after the election. I'd say, if what I've read is true, the police and military committing murder and assault in the streets know they have their comrades next to them and their military behind them so they feel comfortable taking out their transgressions on the protesters. Either that or they're eyes deep in propaganda to the point they think the protesters are something else.

Yeah, I know your police aren‚Äôt there to protect you, that was literally my point. They brutalised the American citizens and your guns did nothing to help you. The entire world saw this. 
I‚Äôm not here to tell you to fix your gun control problem, it‚Äôs your country you can do what you want. If you want to keep shooting each other then what business is it of mine. But don‚Äôt pretend guns actually help against a tyrannical government.

 You‚Äôre currently living in a police state and you‚Äôre to scared to shoot back. It‚Äôs a low bar to set when you have to compare yourself to Myanmar and say ‚Äúwell at least we‚Äôre better than that‚Äù. You use your guns on unarmed civilians, not to protection from the police.

Speaking of the red cross, it might be worth looking into how they were formed. Medics used to get attacked back then for similar reasons which lead to soldiers on both sides bleeding out on the battlefield for days..

Yup, you're correct. It's a power grab that was ""justified"" by an election fraud, of which, the claim has literally no proof. Police officers and the military's actions are because they have the guns, not mainly because they have each other. They've been raised in a gated community to have this mindset of ""orders are orders."" It's why they don't worry about their families' safety.

Either could be true. Just take a look at the series of these tweets.

They dare not fight back against someone who is equally armed. In this tweet, a KNU officer, which is an ethnic armed organization that has entered a ceasefire treaty with the junta previously, pointed the gun at the police and forced them to release the protesters

Gun violence compared to ‚Äúfists‚Äù is not even close, with firearms winning by a landslide. The whole ‚Äú swimming pools kill people so should we ban them‚Äú is such an unsophisticated non nuanced way of thinking. I mean, if we are playing stupid games then I can join in. One punch can kill so should we cut off everyone‚Äôs hands? You have metal detectors at schools, you have a device used in war to detect the direction of gun fire installed in some of you cities, you have a mass shooting on average every day. Your country is renowned for its gun violence. 

Guns are literally designed to kill people, that‚Äôs their purpose, that was the reason for their inception. But like I said, regarding you gun laws, change them or don‚Äôt change them it‚Äôs up to you. It‚Äôs your country do whatever you want. But if we are pretending that you guys would use them for defence against a tyrannical government then you must be waiting for them to come slaughter you in mass because that‚Äôs the only thing they haven‚Äôt done. 

There was plenty video evidence of how the police behaved during the protest which later turned to riots. It‚Äôs not the first time you‚Äôve rioted over police brutality by the way. There‚Äôs also plenty of video evidence dating back many decades of how the police treat your citizens. A vast majority of the time they have zero consequences, they may even get a paid vacation or a promotion. 

I‚Äôm not saying it was anything like Myanmar. All I‚Äôm saying is if we are comparing it to that it‚Äôs a low, low bar to set.  

If you don‚Äôt think you have to defend yourself against being shot at (tear gas/ metal cases in rubber), beaten, run over, abducted...then how free are you? Because that‚Äôs what they did. But if you‚Äôre okay with it then great. I just think it‚Äôs rich when Americans give advice on gun control.

I know some people will say that he has to have congress say yes. However that is not exactly true. The president can't send the army, navy, or airforce without congress. But every president can 100% deploy Marine forces anywhere for anything, but it is for a limited time. Maybe 90 or 120 days, something along those lines. Then they must withdraw, however they can be re inserted after being withdrawn.

Maybe the world police could be something more than a damn sheriff? Maybe somthing every country pools a certain number of resources into, maybe even each country trains in a certain amount of people to be apart of the world police. Basically some sort of organization or military (for lack of a better term), and this military does not take orders from any one country. But when shit goes down somewhere, they deploy. 

Not all countries need to do this however, this is just to ensure pure neutrality when it comes to that country fucking up. So they choose to do it, or not.

Oh the country they deployed on retaliated? Well now that country has the entire world pissed off at them, because they killed/attacked their people. As this military has everyone in it. I think it might be trully neutral, especially with those in charge selected by each country. Maybe voted in?

However, the bigger the US was getting, the more the people and the government was considering moving them West. This goes along with any other tribe.

I‚Äôm not mad though because when they moved a lot of these natives to reservations, their land was put upon what was considered the ‚Äúworst‚Äù land just because it was hard to be able to grown.. but now this age, native land has a lot of non renewable resources and the government is trying to take that away from the people again.

650,lwpl71,560,2,"For the argument that redditors are not upvoting Myanmar related news to the top, my point still stands. You agree that we do see (one or 2) posts on r/all .

However, I agree and admit that I am not seeing the same frequency of posts as HK at its peak, at the moment.

What I don‚Äôt understand is how people are crying conspiracy, accusing people of playing dumb, or saying that people aren‚Äôt paying attention. The news *is* hitting the front page. What more do they want?

Do we really *need* a post hitting the top in multiple subs, or is a few posts hitting the top of r/all enough to say that people are paying attention?"

653,lwpl71,567,1,"Again, you didn't answer my question... What makes you think these ""police"" wouldn't think twice with the high possibility of bullets flying back at them?

The ill equipped and trained Myanmar ""police/military"" are the only ones to have guns so of course they want to use them and they feel more empowered to use those guns because there is NO possibility for them to get killed by a hail of bullets. 

One person with a semi automatic rifle can pin down an entire company of well trained soldiers with automatic rifles for hours if not days. Multiply that one person with a rifle with hundreds if not thousands of motivated people with rifles trying to take back their country from thugs. In the mean time, look up wars Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam etc etc."

656,lwpl71,570,1,"oh you want me to entertain a hypothetical, ""what if the Myanmar people wrre suddenly armed, would the police be such dicks?"" type of question...

seems rather folly.

you're just trying to justify your gun ownership.

and to be quite frank, I'm all for guns, they're fun. but lets not pretend an armed society stymies this type of military behavior. democracy takes full credit for that.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam... I know the wars well... none of these cases had civilian gun ownership. the arms were supplied by outside governments. so im not sure your point, other than rebellions can be successful with guns. which, i mean, sure... after you government has been destabilized.
course in the case of nam, it was more ""home field advantage""... that wasnt a rebellious war at all, it was an invasion.  again, i dont follow your point."

659,lwpl71,573,2,"Nice change of goal posts mate. You're avoiding my question again. My question wasn't to ""entertain a hypothetical"" rather to was to question your line of thinking on a general level and not just for Myanmar. I'm trying to understand why you think the way you do.

Stay on topic please. Changing topics shows you're only trying to avoid my question.

You claimed Police/Military wouldn't think twice to do what the Myanmar police/military is doing to it's citizens if people were armed and shooting back. Again, why wouldn't they think twice when there is a high chance they will get killed instantly in this type of situation vs no chances of getting killed?

I'm not saying ""what if this"" or ""what if that"". I am asking you why do you think the way you do. Explain the logic to me."
660,lwpl71,574,2,"Nice edit. 

Democracy sure took full credit in Myanmar lol. Democracy didn't help the people in Myanmar when the military took over did it?

Regardless of how people got guns (whether foreign funding or civilian), the point is that police and military does think twice when fighting against a armed population vs when it doesn't contrary to your claim. 

You pointing out ""civilian gun ownership"" has nothing to do with what the original point was about. I see you trying to deflect and change goal posts. Nice."
661,lwpl71,576,1,"It‚Äôs really not. It‚Äôs inconsistent reasoning. You judge Australian soldiers by an extreme minority, refusing to work with them. Whilst accepting working with U.S soldiers who commit atrocities and war crimes at a far greater frequency."
662,lwpl71,577,1,"because most police forces and militaries will not fight toe to toe in these scenarios...

dan and the boys lose against a black hawk.

not every civilian would or could be armed, every cop and soldier will be, thats called leverage. ""lay down your arms or neighbor sally is goin in the hole""

a civilian properly trained to hold his own against a military coup is rare, those types are vastly outnumbered and out powered.

im not avoiding your question, you just don't like my answers.

guns are for recreation, not tyranny defense, just admit it and get a grip.

again, fuckin stupid mate."
663,lwpl71,578,1,"dude, you're clueless.

muh gunnnzzzz lol."
664,lwpl71,579,1,I‚Äôm not sure how you can come to the conclusion that working with armed forces from your own country (for which Americans have no choice) who do bad things sometimes and working with another group (where we do have a choice) is somehow inconsistent reasoning. If you‚Äôre really not able to see the difference here then I think that‚Äôs a ‚Äúyou‚Äù problem.
665,lwpl71,580,2,"Ah, the old tanks, planes, drones against a rebellion. A black hawk cannot track and enforce underground movements, civil disobedience, active organizing, etc. A Blackhawk cannot track Dan and all his hundred if not thousands of well motivated friends who are fighting against a unjust military coup. Tanks, jets, drones can only destroy cities and neighborhoods. It takes police and military personals to enforce the coup. Nice hypothetical though. But you falling back to ""Blackhawks"" shows that you do believe police and military would think twice on doing what the Myanmar police and military are doing to it's people if they were armed. Thanks for finally answering my question, though it's sad I had to find out after not answering the question, changing goalposts, etc.

Also, a ""Blackhawk"" is mostly a logistics vehicles and not for actual combat though it can be used during those situations. You seem not to know what you're talking about unfortunately."

They also killed a doctor for supporting NLD. There‚Äôs a rumor that our leader of NLD is on a hunger strike. Our country needs help but the UN isn‚Äôt doing shit. 

They are scaring people to not protest but we fought back, not physically. I‚Äôve experienced this before a few weeks ago. The soldiers came to our peaceful neighborhood to create chaos because were too quite. They shot guns on the street. A street dog attack the soldiers and got shot by the soldiers. Thankfully they didn‚Äôt come blasting the door down and killing us. Although this happened to many neighborhoods. We were lucky 

This isn‚Äôt a cool thing. People are dying for our country and the fighting back. A dad was carrying his dead son and crying and shouting

>guns dont kill people jackass, people do

*People with guns*. I'm not sure why gun nuts think this is an effective argument. Nobody has ever suggested that guns kill people without being fired by humans. It really doesn't change the argument at all. Access to guns, and their relative speed and ease of use when it comes to killing people, results in thousands more murders. It also drives the suicide rate, and is why we have so many cases of parents killing their own kids. People are way, way more likely to kill with a gun than they are with a knife or any other weapon, and for good reason. Guns offer a quick, clean and easy way to kill. Most people are too squeamish to start hacking at human flesh with a knife. You have to be right on your victim, right up close to the blood and the guts, with your victim fighting back. Guns give people the option of killing from a distance, without having to deal with the gore and the tearing of flesh and the fighting back. Having a gun in the drawer gives people going through moments of flashpoint rage a quick and convenient method to act on that rage in a deadly fashion, where that rage would have passed without murder had there been no gun available. Also established fact: gun owners are more likely to die by gunfire than non gun owners, and their kids are more likely to be murdered. Guns are *very much* the issue here, and I very much *do* know what I'm talking about. 

>...you just hate America for no reason dont you

Classic conservative gun nut dipshit logic. The person who actually *cares* about the death and destruction that guns inflict upon America must *hate* the country, whereas the people who *don't give a shit* about all the murder and death that guns inflict on America are the ""*real patriots.*"" Conservatism in this country is quickly headed to the trashcan of history, for good reason, and good riddance."
854,lvvvm8,320,1,"Well, if we take ""developed"" countries to mean high-income countries (we can lose the ""western"" if you like), then yes the US has the highest murder rate of them.

What do you mean birghter future of persecuted groups? Its literally 1 group and she denied their genocide. As such there would be no ""brighter future"" until they either flea or are dead. One small UN intervention would have stopped your military coup d'√©tat from happening.

If youre talking about ASRA then yeah they are at war with them. I dont condone what they do/did but they only popped up when they started getting killed.

In India, the government is in charge of the military; in Myanmar, the military is in charge of itself. No, there wasn‚Äôt dead silence regarding the Rohingya in this country. 

Have some empathy man. When I hear about what goes on in India I don‚Äôt think: ‚Äúoh well, they deserve it, they voted for Modi after all!‚Äù I knew someone that was killed today. 19 years old, full of life and courage.

1. Suu Kii is a hypocrite and a tyrant who went along with the military's genocidal plan.
2. Suu Kii was against the plan but her government never held true power in the country, thus Myanmar was never a democracy in the first place, just a sham
3. Suu Kii was just a puppet for the military all along.

Now, if it's not (1), then the question arises, what did Suu Kii do to anger the military enough for them to take over; what agenda did she have that was more important for her than the lives of thousands of Rohingyas?

Your stupid ass hypothesis doesn't hold water. Even from your perspective, it's clear that the Burmese gave 0 shits when minorities were being killed, and suddenly all the sacrifices made for political games became too much when they themselves were the ones on the losing end."

When the military was committing genocide against the Rohingya people,  **Aung San Suu Kyi** was silent, and denied it. The people on Myanmar were silent and took no action.

Now YOU are the ones that are being shot and killed. How do you feel now that it is happening to you? Do you wish you had stood up for justice and peace when it was only the Rohingya being murdered? Do you now realize the pain they felt? Can you feel empathy now?

I hope the military Junta are destroyed and sent to jail, but i also hope that the people of Myanmar can self reflect. I hope in the future they can stand up for justice for ALL of Myanmar's people.

#training in firearms to kill doesn't erase the sin to shoot an unarmed teenager running away from you in the back of her head. Full stop.

I said ""can"" mean morally u can choose to shot and not aim for the head, giving some possibility of not killing. Aiming for the head gives zero change to survive and that is intent. Hypothetically i am ordered to shoot u. U want it on your head or anywhere else?

Ok. U are trained to shoot. So?

U are trained to kill. So?

U are ordered to fire but what type of person will (allegedly listen to orders) and shoot the head of an unarmed kid? And she was running away! Shot in the back? U trained to do that?

What a lovely way to infantilise a whole nation. Revolutions have been performed in worse circumstances. 

We can, and should, draw attention to the cause. We can also provide financial aid to any protesting organisations. However, to think that any direct intervention wouldn't result in the same military catastrophe as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is short-sighted at best."

They have routinely shown to exploit that position for their own profits. 

They have installed puppet dictators to get cheap oil. They have assassinated innocent left-wing activists because they threaten American profits. They‚Äôve couped entire democratically-elected governments just to squash any talk of nationalising precious resources. 

Why do you think America would stop this, when this happens in America without repercussion? If they- you- cannot even reign in your own police force, what gives you the audacity to think you‚Äôd reign in your troops? Because you didn‚Äôt in the middle east, you didn‚Äôt in latin america... instead, your country made a whole law that if **anyone** held American soldiers to account for war crimes, they would **invade that country**. 

The moral obligation you speak of isn‚Äôt to ramp up your evidently morally corrupt military. There‚Äôs an argument for helping monetarily, but even then, America can‚Äôt be trusted to not include predatory payback terms in that help- ‚Äúwe‚Äôll help you out, if you let us do x y and z‚Äù. 

The moral obligation is to realise you‚Äôre not better than these people and that you need to fix your own broken system that defines ‚Äúany male over 16‚Äù as a terrorist so long as they‚Äôre in a country that the US is bombing or invading. The moral obligation is to stop American companies profiting off of war & tragedy.

What I mean is you faced starvation, children born with skin and bone (from starvation), people being put in prison, executed, and etc...?  Vietnam from 1975 to the death of Le Duan (most evil man in Vietnam history) was similar if not worst than North Korea, which is why the boat people happen and 250,000 people perished at sea but it was better than to stay behind.  You had a handful of rice and one tiny meat as food every three weeks.

I want to make sure that what you are saying as I want to understand what really happen under this military dictatorship so I can better the situation and how dire it is.  Because Myanmar was shut out from the world for so long, most of Southeast Asia didn't particularly pay attention to Myanmar and can only guess what went on during those time.

So I want to ask you this question.  If the military dictatorship win, will they treat the country similar to how Vietnam is right now or will it go back to 1962 all over again?  I don't know any Burmese people in the U.S so the only info I get is from the news and social media which isn't a lot to go on."

Now like you said, it hasn't always worked out great when the US gets involved. The countries mentioned above are the best examples  I could think of, but there are many more that I can't put on that list. Vietnam, Irak, Afghanistan, etc have all been failures. 

 That is exactly why I think we need to go to Myanmar. The US has had a bad record of trying to be the world police. But if it's not gonna be US, then nobody will try. We are in a unique position to reshape the American identity back to what it was post WWII. And by God do we need that."

Also, the fact that you needed to put ""etc."" on the failures should be very telling to yourself about your biases lmao

The US has taken every opportunity it has ever been given of being world police, from Lybia to Haiti, Cuba to Iran, Iraq to Vietnam, Laos to Afghanistan, Indonesia to Nicaragua, Guatemala to Bolivia, the list could quite literally go on for several more minutes. At best, the people are rewarded with a destabilised US puppet state with a thin veil of corrupt parliamentary representation ultimately decided by American interests covering military bases and resource extraction, and at worst they are left with fascist oligarchies and open air slave markets in what used to be some of the most developed countries of the region. The last time the US did anything even remotely good in terms of foreign interference was tackling the Nazis, and even that was done out of desperation when they realised their policy of isolationism was gonna let the USSR gain more influence. The US has always been an imperialist oligarchy just looking for new land to conquer and influence, and this would be no different."

People trained with firearms will be shooting for center mass if they are shooting *at* you. I believe implying there is a ""less lethal"" way for soldiers/police to shoot people gives people that don't know about guns a false sense of security in situations like this. If you tell people ""relax, they will probably just shoot to injure is"" they will take dangerous risks that could get them killed. You could risk someone elses life by giving them false info."
987,lwof70,112,2,"Yeah if it goes back to 1962, I think its over for the people of Myanmar.  It will be a long time before Myanmar can even catch up to the rest of Southeast Asia as if I'm not mistaken Myanmar is the poorest country in Southeast Asia?  Even poorer than Cambodia and Laos?

I had this talk with my dad after asking you this question.  My dad say the Myanmar military is not as bad as the VCP because the VCP follow a communist doctrine while the Junta have no such doctrine.  He also said that the soldiers are loyal to the VCP while the Myanmar soldiers are not brainwash as only the top leader of the military are corrupt and cruel.  He said there are bad soldiers but not all soldiers are bad.  We both agree that if Myanmar fall again, people of Myanmar will be worst than the Vietnamese.  He explain that it will feel much worst due to anger as Myanmar got to experience a quasi-democrat government.

He say the main differences between the Junta and VCP is Myanmar was colonized by the British which gave them autonomy and independent when they left while Vietnam was colonized by the French which destablized Vietnam after they left.  This is why communism will never happen in Myanmar despite the fact that it does seem to have CCP backing.

One thing I would like to ask you is why do you think that Myanmar will go back to 1962 instead of Vietnam currently?  The reason I ask is that while Vietnam GDP grow every year, the VCP literally steal 95% of the country wealth.  In 2014 alone, the U.S had to froze bank account because the VCP stole 146 billions from the Vietnamese people.  146 billions X 46 years (different GDP but you get the point) and that why Vietnam is still a poor country.  Same with Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and etc...

Let me know if you think anything my dad said is wrong?"
988,lwof70,113,1,"I didn't advocate for that, I said what I said and you deflected."
989,lwof70,114,2,"Ah... good. U are calm now. Let's discuss further. 

Yes. Soldiers are trained to kill. Having mercy to enemies is being unmerciful to ourselves as well as the men next to you. In fact, headshot is golden. And we are taught to squeeze twice in CQB and FIBUA.

But these assholes are not dealing with armed enemies who are going to kill them (thou i believe at this point many alreay mentally killing these assholes). They are killing unarmed, non life threatening civilians! 

I dont mean to tell people to relax, the army is just aiming to injure. All the protestants knows these army are capable to be heartlessly aiming to kill in the head in one shot like game.

But i am coming from a perspective of a myanmar soldier with an ounce of conscience... that perhaps even under orders, could target anywhere but the head. Maybe some of them exist, hence some stray rounds..... BUT let me be crystal clear here just in case....

#to our heroes here... know that the military is capably to kill. Please be smart, stay safe. Run if you must, take cover. And live to see a truly democratic myanmar in the near future.

They know the risk. They know someone may be killed. Yet they stand up as one without violence. They are heroes.

We may have started off on the wrong foot but I'm glad we can engage in a more meaningful discussion now.

Cheers."
990,lwof70,115,2,"1) Most of the soldiers including their family are brain washed
2) Not only customs but also generals are already brain wash because they get lots of benefits from their work
3)The history of 1962 start because of Nay Win. He made plans and protocol about military coup and how to manage the army.How to control the Civilians and the news. This military coup depend on his protocol.
4)I don't want to compare with Vietnam because I don't know exactly about Vietnam and I visited there only one time but Myanmar Civilians are killed by military.This is happening in Myanmar even in arban cities, capital cities of Myanmar.

993,lwof70,118,1,"Do Myanmar citizen (not Rohingya) get kill for no reason or only when they oppose the military like now?  Like do the Junta kill civilians for no reason from 1962 to 2011?

I forgot to mention one thing I talked with my dad was that, the Junta only had 25% of the seat in parlament in 2011.  We both strongly agree that this would never happen with the VCP or the CCP or any communist regime, they would laugh so hard at you and then execute you in some far away prison in some rural place.  This show to me and my dad (could be wrong) that the Junta are not as dangerous as the VCP.

I'm not downplaying the Junta, they are evil, I just want to understand how evil they are.  The communist soldiers already murdered millions of my people prior, during, and after the Vietnam War.  And we have over 10,000 political prisoners in Vietnam today.  People who want freedom for Vietnam so badly, some of them include Vietnamese Americans as well.  There is no freedom regardless of where you live if it isn't in your home country.

Do you know of any book that is written by Burmese about the Junta or what they did to the country from 1962 to 2011?"
994,lwof70,119,2,"Lol.... we all wished for that!

But that's not an ounce of conscience. It's BALLS OF STEEL!

Speaking of there are people who defects. We hope there are fine and safe. They military/police leaders are vengeful people.

You seen the photos where a bunch of police pissd on the flowers people laid on the site of a young boy killed? Makes my blood boils. Real incorrigible assholes.

Back to your statement.... that's one of the best outcome. really really wished for that to happen."
995,lwof70,120,1,"Wayyy late, but I'll tell what I know  during my time around 2003-2010s and experience from my parents. Sorry if these are what you already known.  


The ethnic groups had it wayy worse than people in mainland. I have not heard getting killed for no reasons in mainland we were safe as long as we keep our heads down.  


I think the majority of their evil comes from economy!? After Ne Win took power, everyone had their possessions robbed by military(Cars, Businesses, etc) by various ranks from military(Majors, Captains etcs) leaving civilians dirt poor. Plus he denounced some of the currency that were in use because of some superstition, that hit the economy really hard too.  


Top brass controls almost every big corps here, some of them are billionaires(USD).One of the things I have experienced is the mobile phone scam. Myanmar Post and Telecommunication sold their first SIM cards around 5000usd per card around early 2000s and stayed over 1000usd for a long time. They even sold their last sim cards months before foreign telco companies come in with price of around 200$ as a last attempt. SIM cards are worth 1$ here now.  


If you do try to oppose the military its almost  guaranteed you are going to get jailed or tortured or killed. Everyone lived in fear, they do not dare to even have pictures of Aung San Suu Kyi or NLD Flag in their homes and hides them if they do.  


Unfortunately, I know about Vietnam only from a documentary. From what I could tell, the situation is really different as in there were a lot of people supporting north side. We do not have sides here, its always been people vs Military.

#Comment aider le peuple du Myanmar dans son combat pour la libert√© si vous √™tes dans un autre pays?

# Que s'est-il pass√© et pourquoi ?

Le 1er f√©vrier 2021, les militaires du Myanmar, dirig√©s par le commandant en chef Min Aung Hlaing, ont organis√© un coup d'√âtat et renvers√© avec succ√®s le gouvernement d√©mocratiquement √©lu. Le Myanmar a √©t√© soumis √† une dictature militaire s√©v√®re pendant cinq d√©cennies, de 1962 √† 2011. La brutalit√© et les nombreux crimes commis par les militaires, notamment des g√©nocides et des crimes de guerre, sont √©vidents dans son histoire. Le tristement c√©l√®bre chef du coup d'√âtat, Min Aung Hlaing, est connu pour une multitude de crimes allant de la discrimination syst√©mique et des violations des droits de l'homme √† l'encontre des groupes minoritaires au nettoyage ethnique contre le peuple Rohingya, pour lesquels il a fait l'objet d'une condamnation et de sanctions internationales.

Apr√®s le coup d'√âtat et la d√©tention de plusieurs responsables d√©mocratiquement √©lus par la population civile, les citoyens du Myanmar ont commenc√© √† manifester pacifiquement dans tout le pays et ont particip√© au Mouvement de d√©sob√©issance civile (CDM). Cependant, les forces arm√©es ont impitoyablement trait√© les manifestants pacifiques et les participants au CDM √† l'aide de balles r√©elles, d'incendies criminels, d'enl√®vements et de m√©thodes de torture impensables qui ont fini par entra√Æner des morts tragiques. Aussi d√©primant que cela puisse √™tre, il convient de donner quelques exemples de l'abomination perp√©tr√©e par les forces arm√©es inhumaines :

‚Ä¢ Une femme enceinte a √©t√© abattue d'une balle √† bout portant dans la t√™te pour avoir aid√© des manifestants pacifiques √† se cacher dans sa maison

‚Ä¢ Un √©tudiant en m√©decine a √©t√© tu√© pour avoir tent√© de sauver des bless√©s dans une rue de la ville

‚Ä¢ Un militant a √©t√© enlev√© et tortur√© √† mort en lui versant de l'acide ou un liquide extr√™mement chaud dans la bouche et en l'√©ventrant.

‚Ä¢ La police a secr√®tement d√©terr√© la tombe d'un manifestant de 19 ans tu√© par balle, ce qui a provoqu√© une nouvelle vague d'indignation et suscit√© des soup√ßons de dissimulation.

Plus de 200 personnes ont √©t√© tu√©es au moment o√π nous √©crivons ces lignes et des milliers de civils ont √©t√© d√©tenus ill√©galement. Les h√©ros qui ont donn√© leur vie en luttant pour la libert√© sont, entre autres, des hommes politiques, des m√©decins, des moines, des femmes enceintes et des enfants.

Les atrocit√©s commises par les militaires augmentent de jour en jour et ces crimes d'une sauvagerie extr√™me doivent cesser. Malgr√© ces circonstances, le peuple du Myanmar continue de d√©fendre ses droits et sa libert√©. Le sacrifice des h√©ros tomb√©s au combat ne doit pas √™tre vain.

(Edit : cela ne fait pas partie de l'article original, mais j'ai trouv√© une liste assez compl√®te des crimes de Tatmadaw et des preuves - c'est en anglais, cependant. [La situation au Myanmar] (https://www.myanmarspringrevolution.org/crimes.html))

#Comment vous pouvez aider et faire partie de cette r√©volution:

Les fonctionnaires et les civils ont particip√© √† la gr√®ve en sacrifiant leurs emplois et leurs revenus. En outre, en raison des nombreux incendies criminels, actes de vandalisme et autres actes de violence, certaines personnes ont perdu leur maison ou ont d√ª l'abandonner pour se d√©placer vers des lieux plus s√ªrs. Visitez le site Mutual Aid Myanmar pour aider la population du Myanmar en r√©pondant directement √† ses besoins √©conomiques de base. Vous pouvez √©galement contribuer √† la collecte de fonds organis√©e par le CRPH, le gouvernement d√©mocratique parall√®le qui tente de vaincre la junte militaire.

Si vous tenez absolument √† participer √† ce combat, vous pouvez organiser des manifestations pacifiques l√† o√π vous vivez. Veuillez v√©rifier aupr√®s des autorit√©s locales avant d'en organiser une.
Il est √©galement utile de contacter votre repr√©sentant ou votre membre du Congr√®s par lettre, courriel ou appel t√©l√©phonique pour lui faire part de votre position sur la situation au Myanmar et de votre approbation pour l'envoi de toute forme d'aide, qu'il s'agisse d'une aide militaire, de sanctions cibl√©es ou de toute autre m√©thode de soutien viable.

I'm new user, and I wanted to help sharing this post with the tags as a crosspost in my profile. (?) But not sure if I did it the right way. But anyway, I'm going to share in my social media.

1. Self Destruct

The support level for the coup is so low that only people who are opportunistic and same flocks will openly join them. But the more worrying fact is there are many of those who would join them if the junta were to behave a little better. They were using the mass psychology to show their worst and people will accept if the situation is a little bit better. But don‚Äôt forget they do not give in or relax anything since they control the country administrative power.

It sounds wrong but the peaceful protests gets you no where, what will that accomplish? If you want to overthrow then petition for USA to help you because they got the biggest military budget in the world. Just don‚Äôt go Isis on them (Hillary and company supported the rebellion, and that rebellion later became Isis). If not the USA then I guess ask China but honestly your asking for another wave of ‚Äúre-education‚Äù and forced assimilation to accept their ideology or else you will be sent to camps, whereas USA will just end up outsourcing company factories to Myanmar for cheaper wage and more efficient product manufacturing.

While this is quite cold-hearted, the people of Myanmar can go fuck right off. Vietnam have literally no interest in interfering with the situation in Myanmar.

What needed to be said have already been make clear. Vietnam wishes that the current military government de-escalated and brought back stabilization in the region as soon as possible. The protesters have been nothing but troubles for Vietnamese interest in the region. They destroying Mytel (a sub-company of Viettel) business but now asking us to help them? We literally have no obligation to give a shit about Myanmar's domestic problems. Even if we're, ASEAN prevented us against doing anything about it.

Also the last time we actually did anything for a neighboring country, we were seen as invaders. Too much Vietnamese blood have been spilled and it was all for nothing.

and

 

Then they shouldn't have insulted us/ causing risk to our citizens/ damaging our business first then.

And back then when we fought for independence, we certainly didn't ask other countries to send their army in to help us. While we make it through by foreign weapons, the blood that been spilled were our and our alone. If the Burmese refused to fight for themselves but wanted other to solve their problems, they don't deserve a single bit of help from us.

I will use those harsh words as much as I like. What does the protesters known about Vietnam history? How much bodies that we buried to get to the present? Do they understand how much is the price for independence and freedom? No, because judging by their ridiculous demand that foreign army to set up shop on their land, they don't have a single idea. Do they have any right to demanded anything from Vietnam? Absolutely not, we don't share a border with them, we don't care about their domestic problems and the international laws forbid us from doing anything to interfere. Yet these people keep painting us as the villain, because we ""refused"" to help them.

u/aister once said:

 

Unpopular opinion and probably a cruel one at that, but Myanmar people got wat they deserved. They said absolutely nothing about the atrocities their own government did on Rohingyas, and now the same people who carried out those atrocity took power and did the same to them, they are complaining? Why does it matter only when they are the victims?

I don't support the coup nor the new gov. But at the same time, the old government wasn't all angels either. And unless the protesters start including the Rohingyas in their ""peace plan"", expect no support coming from me.

So one very very small faction of the entire population of a specific race are extremists and that gives you the right to say in general rohingyas are not innocent, so should i assume all 1.5 Million people you drive out of myanmar are terrorists huh???
Does it make any sense?"
1056,m85p3l,117,1,"So how manyyyyyyy hindus also committed these actions. How many of your military dogs committed these actions before. Stop. Ok?

BUT  This does not solve anything i hope you defeat them and welcome the ROhingya back. Your country is known for treating minorities like crap their whole life. Lok at the citizen ship and passports system you have so please spare me the details. You supported your military to this. THis is why the world feels weird lack of apathy BUT wont solve issue. That same military will do worse to the rest of Rohingyas that are there. Want to know something interesting? the same propoganda your government used to talk about rohingyas is what your using. So do you actually hate the Bunta and their ways? or just when its convenient for you? Use this knowledge be humble do better and try not do DIE a racist or some one on the dark side of history.

From what I've learnt, some Rohingya armed forces did commit atrocities against Hindus but that doesn't make millions terrorists.

It's ridiculous that a totalitarian regime like the CCP who won't let it's people vote and oppose democracy are allowed to vote in the UN to block intervention in a coup against democracy while supplying arms to the perpetrators of the atrocities concerned.

 Basically Xi Jinping can veto any resolution that prevents him  illegally installing a lapdog in Myanmar that has repeatedly commited genocide, crimes against humanity and countless atrocities against it's own civilians. Even though CCP have no regard for international law themselves.

It's a bit like Hitler being able to prevent any intervention in the holocaust simply by voting against it."
1061,m85p3l,128,1,"CCP will no doubt be planning to send PLA under the guise of UN peacekeepers to protect CCP interests and personnel in Myanmar. CCP policy is to keep Myanmar poor and weak which gives CCP more influence, political and economic opportunities.

 So they will let all the Myanmar factions fight a little longer while making $$$billions on arms sales to all sides. CCP will never let democracy take hold in Myanmar and will support the Tatmadaw to do anything to stop it but also keeping them weak.

 Eventually the CCP wii role into Myanmar spelling the end to the democratic movement on their door step and secure access to the Indian Ocean reducing reliance on the Mallaca strait for 90% of China's oil imports and enable them to continue their objective of total global domination by 2049. This is WW3 and the whole world better wake up

At least you expose the mentality of both yourself and the genocidal organisations you support, and i hope many people that are unaware of the mind set of people like you and the governments of China, Vietnam and the Tatmadaw read your comments and finally relise what dispicable despots they are up against."

And Myanmar‚Äôs democracy is of no concern to USA. Basically both countries could care less. Why? Simple, Myanmar as it stands is not in a strategic location which do not benefit either hence the lack of response. If Myanmar was in the Middle East you can bet a million they ain‚Äôt gonna back down. 

Just because you have a simple mindset that cannot comprehend and understand how the world works do not entitle or empower you to insult others. I basically stated loud and clear that I stand with you guys and even quoted your civil disobedience movement and there you go accusing me or a stupid CCP warrior LOL. It‚Äôs beyond me. If you ask me why Myanmar is in such predicament and why it‚Äôs still developing this is precisely it. Myanmar exist citizens in which they cannot hold intelligent conversations of world affairs and simply think in layman terms.

Funny how you ‚Äúpraise‚Äù my English since it‚Äôs my first language lol the sarcasm bruh your command of grammar and vocab r dipshit.

Wat is not an opinion, is fact. A chicken sandwich is a fact. It is real, provable using subjective and scientific method, thus it is a fact.

Also, I don't really care if my opinion is right or wrong. Heck I don't really care if u say it's not an opinion it's evil reincarnate. I will stand with it even if u kill me for it. Isn't that wat the Myanmar people are doing as well?

And I expressed sadness for that and I implied that it is the Burmese people that could regain the power and restore democracy and give power back to the rightful government NLD. It simply means that. People power. I even supported the civil disobedience movement. Do you even understand what your writing and your accusations? I am explaining world politics to you but you fail to understand and simply think just because I quoted China and that means I am a CCP bot. 

Honestly there are tons like you on my countries media page CNA of Singapore. for example quoting outdated information like 9 killed instead of 11 and then the entire comment section got nuked. Cmon it‚Äôs our countries news page and what gives Burmese the right to argue for correction to the news and be angry about a outdated information and scolding the news media? It‚Äôs exactly like your behaviour. It‚Äôs not doing any good to Myanmar sentiments for foreigners who often get insulted, verbal abused for quoting something different than what your pea brain can understand. An apology from you is in order if not no worries. I can‚Äôt be bothered to continue this thread with you. Some other Burmese smarter than you would understand what I mean.

1082,m85p3l,164,9,"Not OP, but first and foremost, while I'm on the minority I will say this. What our government did to the Rohingya people was wrong.

I had said that many times among my peers and I got shouted down for it.

I respect that you stood up for your opinion.

Sometimes facts and opinions are not that clear-cut. And one can convince themselves on either side of the argument.

I'm not going to defend my people for being silent about the atrocities committed to the Rohingya. But I'd like to offer a theory on their rationalization.

Most people are just a racist bunch, that includes Myanmar people.

Most of us have racial biases whether they know it or not. When confronted with complex moral issues, there are very few people who can distinguish right and wrong when the atrocities are committed to the people they dislike.

They'll conflate opinions with facts. Such as 'Roginger people are foreigners, the government has the right to deport them' are some of the common rationalizations I hear from my people.

When clear atrocities come up to the surface they'd still turn a blind eye as nobody wants to admit they're wrong.

If anything it's a lesson for us Myanmar as a people that you have to do the right thing and stand up against the bully even if the bullying is committed to the minority group that you don't empathize with.

I think our people will mature up if we get through this mess. The country was still very much in the learning process especially when it comes to these complex moral and ethical issues as it was still a closed country up until about 2011.

I encourage you to do the same by standing up against the bully even if it's committed against the people you don't agree with or empathize with. By not doing so you risk being complacent and send the wrong message to the other oppressive regimes around the globe that this is okay. The world is less free when someone out there is getting killed, bullied, and tortured."
1083,m85p3l,165,4,"\> Myanmar people is not an opinion. They deserved it, is an opinion. 

How is it an opinion? All of your points have been debunked and all opinions need to have pointed to make them valid.

 

Yes of course. Some things in life are factual and some things are not. For example, if someone‚Äôs opinion that 2+2=5, they would be wrong.

However, most everything is not as deductive as mathematics. For example, if we ask ‚Äúis it hot or cold outside?‚Äù. Well, we can objectively say that the temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. But the observer is what matters here, less so the external world. So one person‚Äôs hot might be another person‚Äôs cold. I might say, it‚Äôs 70 degrees outside and I am cold, and another person would say it‚Äôs 70 degrees outside and I feel hot. Both are mostly true.

As human beings in the universe, everything is perception, and most ‚Äútruths‚Äù about the world are simply **not** independent of our observation.

Most people that work in science and engineering realize that there are cold hard truths about the world that are very true no matter what you do. But there are a lot of people on Earth that operate differently and have trouble accepting or recognizing universal truths or objective facts. Those people are bad, LOL.

&#x200B;

They know what a peaceful country is lol, and there are differences between opinions and facts, wrong and right, what should talk and what shouldn't. You don't like them and support them? Fine but you don't have any permission to mock and insult them. Imagine your country fall into the same situation and nobody will help.

Nazi Germany is evil is a fact, if it is an opinion, you would saying the Jews deserve to die which is disgusting."

when hatred like this takes root, it will be a very powerful weapon for the populists. There are enough historical examples of this, so I was, and still am, really afraid it will happen to my country too.

One thing I find ridiculous, is that even though a large number of population in my country, like urs, are also Buddhists, and always preach that u must love everyone and that karma will come back to bite u, it seems that they have set up their own version of ""everyone"" that doesn't include the Chinese."

USSR was not and has never been our neighbor. That's like saying the UK is neighbor of Hongkong.

Myanmar states are split by ethnicity

Rohingya people claim to be ethnic to Rakhine state. The truth is that whilst some trace back to early Arab traders settling amongst Arakan people, the majority are immigrants from Bangladesh during British rule (in fact encouraged by the British).

If Rohingya are recognised as ethnic (as they desire), that would conflict with Arakan ethnics of the Rakhine state. 

I.e. you cannot give the Rohingya exactly what they want without hurting  another ethnic group. 

The solution is probably something like including Rohingya with full rights as citizens, but not recognising them as ethnic. But it has to be agreed both ways."

But then he claimed he was harassed, while in reality, I was just answering the question, and then later he said he wasn't harassed. Like wat?

He also asked why I didn't reply to him in that thread, while he specifically said, in his last comment, ""let's end this here"". Made me wonder if this guy has amnesia or something.

but just like that, people disagree with my opinion, which is fine and actually expected. And I defend my point. Was it the place to do that? Absolutely not. But this also was not the place for him to post my entire comment, with my username, exposing me for potential harassment from angry mobs.

if I have to defend myself anyway, it's better to do it in a way that everyone can read wat I think as well as any counter points I make. If you don't agree, try to prove that I'm wrong, that there was an actual widespread condemnation of wat was going on with the Rohingya, that the protesters actually include the Rohingya in their version of a peaceful and democratic nation.

I don't need people to solve it, minorities problems are very complicated, [I understand that too well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Oppressed_Races).

Telling me not to say bad things when asked about wat I think, is the definition of oppression and dictatorship.

Did u just become the villain u swore to protect?"
1104,m85p3l,191,3,"Unpopular opinion and probably a cruel one at that, but Myanmar people got wat they deserved. They said absolutely nothing about the atrocities their own government did on Rohingyas, and now the same people who carried out those atrocity took power and did the same to them, they are complaining? Why does it matter only when they are the victims?

I don't support the coup nor the new gov. But at the same time, the old government wasn't all angels either. And unless the protesters start including the Rohingyas in their ""peace plan"", expect no support coming from me.

1105,la59ah,2,51,If reddit could almost crash the stock market i think we can do it to the military
1106,la59ah,5,5,".Let me give you a quick recap of our country's history. The military had control over the country for nearly 30 years in the past, (started off by killing most important generals, straight up gunning down protestors including a couple thousands of students and monks, creating corruption beyond measure, and selling away all the country resources for their own good, letting ppl starve under a dictatorship ).  But since the democratic party won the election in 2015 with a landslide victory, they lost their previous authority/ways get corrupted money. The last 5 years has been quite stable in the country except for the Rohingya crisis that was also carried out by the same murderers from the military. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi went out there at the ICJ for the face and name of the fellow Burmese citizens,(didn't have the power to do anything other than that). Fast forward to the coup happening... 2020 elections saw the most votes for the democratic party in history. Just as the citizens were hoping of erasing their bs laws they had set out during their rule, the military seized all the members who are in charge right in the middle of a parliament meeting. (reasoning that there was fraud in the votes and they had to do the right thing!!) They also staged instability/protests in the country to find a proper reason for an emergency takeover. (also cutting off all networks and phone lines). Most of the democratic leaders and political speakers are now detained and sent to jail for really absurd reasons like( owning a walkie-talkie: how Daw Su was framed, breaking covid safety rules: how our president was framed, and sometimes for no reason). Now they are threatening us with the weapons that we; civilians bought through taxes. The military has a good relationship with China and is ready to illegally sell all of the country's resources once again to get all the money they can for themselves. Now, this may sound highly biased but all of them are certainly true- you can ask Burmese ppl, I doubt that it would be any different.

I am sorry for my English(it is not my mother tongue)"

There is no proof of election fraud and the lies keep switching up. The leaders and the party we voted for has been arrested (on some BS charge like owning walky talkies) and disbanded (kinda). The military stated that there was a state of emergency, which allows them to take over a year, which is stated in the constitution that they wrote. They say they will hold ""free and fair"" elections during the year, but history has shown us that these dogs aren't to be trusted.

So now, we're on the streets to free our leaders and rewrite the constitution, which will lead to a more fair democracy with a more fair ground for ethnic minorities (Rohingyas, Karens and so on). Every night from 8 PM to 4 AM, we have a curfew and they'll shoot us if we're more than 5 during these times. The internet is shut off from 1AM to 9PM. During the nights, they've been arresting activists, students, lawyers, doctors and more. 

Our nights aren't safe and our days aren't safe. So we do what we can for a better future. And the result has been our ppl getting butchered, as seen in the posts. The post doesn't show all deaths so far, just a fraction.

And also spread anti-muslim news on Facebook (most used social media).And national media controlled by the military downplayed the whole crisis keeping most everyday people in the dark.

This all happened after Suu Kyi's party won the election. The military planted many seeds to cause instability to regain control.

I got one of those little books but I lost it.. probably tossed it because it smelled like propaganda.

If I found it I'll upload some images.."
1224,lap93j,10,7,"Western media and ""Trendtivist"" got played by military regarding Rohingya issue like a fiddle.

Military learn from the best in terms of coup, propaganda, brainwashing, creating division, ethnic cleansing and creating fake news from China and Russia.

It also helps that Military have unlimited funds stolen from Myanmar people to hire and dress convicts, uneducated and poor people, junior army men to dress up as both sides to create violence unrest and do their law and order narrative.

Now the west get to watch in horror as all the ethnic minorities like Shan, Kayin and Rakhine including Rohingya and many others are going to be slaughter like back in the Asshole Than Shwe days. There won't be a single journalist to cover the next massacre."

1228,lap93j,21,3,Western people have culturally been programmed to believe that any governance of other countries is far inferior to them and the result is that they often miss the point when applying their worldview to what happen in country like myanmar.
1229,lap93j,23,2,"Furthermore there is an ongoing love affair among western liberal institutions to go around searching constantly for injustices against muslims around the world to fit their bizarre and whacky narrative that is peddled to them at universities day and night. Nobody really knows why this is the case, but in the case of Myanmar, every activist nosering campus dyke and spinster will rush to the aid of the rohingya without even realizing there are 300 or more minority groups in our country who likewise need help and suffer under the despotic shitty and incompetent military elite, not to mention bamar people themselves."
1230,lap93j,24,2,"Thanks for the explanation. It's hard to believe that the leader of the country from 2016 to 2021 had no power to stop or condemn the military actions. The military is completely fucked then.

The reason why the people criticized her is because the Rohingya muslims raped and slaughtered a Rakhine race girl and harmed other ethnic groups living in Myanmar and almost all of them don't consider the country Myanmar as their own. They don't even know the national language, literature or anthem! So, it's definitely not easy for Myanmar people to accept them as the citizens."
1249,lap93j,56,3,"Military gangraped and massacred Rohingya people. It is no secret and it is true. What they did was not for pleasure but for systemic ethnic cleansing. However, ASSK has no responsibility because she has no power over Military.

As for why Military did those, it is for 2 reasons:

1) Military hates Rohingya people and they want to scare them so they run away completely.

2) They want to cause politic instability in Myanmar and tarnish ASSK's reputation in the international community.

If you ask me if we condone rape and murder, not really. Buddhists are pacificts and our precepts are crystal clear. Two of them are: ""we shall not rape,"" and ""we shall not kill"". If you betray these oaths, after you swore them, you are punished in hell. If you do those even without oaths, you still suffer karmic retribution. So no, we don't like that. ASSK is the same.

However, the entirety of Myanmar have neutral, dislike, and hate relationship with Rohingya people. To understand that, you need to know there are 4 categories of Rohingya people.

1st category - descendants of Muslim merchants from 1000 years ago.

2nd category - descendants of working slaves for railway projects during the British colonial era. 

3rd category - descendants of Muslim population India pleaded us to temporarily take in when they were facing starvation.

4th category - illegal immigrants from Bengladesh through porous borders.

So, among them. We are very fine with the 1st category and they are even an elite class in our country. They are rich and influential.

About the 2nd category, we dislike them because during the world war, they took opposite side to commit genocides on us.

About the 3rd category, we pitied them at that time but it was supposed to be temporary which became permanent because India conveniently forgot about them.

About the 4th category, we hate them with passion because they commit gangrapes and serial killings in broad daylight. About 10 years ago in Rakhine state, before all these clearance operations started, do you know the happenings in there? We have serial murder and rape cases in Rakhine state almost every day because Rohingya population of certain areas outnumber Rakhine population by 1 to 10. Without Mabatha's or Military's interventions, Rakhine ethnics would have been completely annihilated by now.

Mabatha and Military are allies and we dislike both. But they have different goals. Mabatha for instance does not rape. They just kill and look down on rohingya as ugly monsters who threaten peace. They are headed by Extremist Monk Wirathu. However, they are compassionate towards Rakhine ethnics. Military on the other hand just seeks constant benefits. They save Rakhine ethnics to get popularity support. In fact, the Military also rapes and murders Rakhine ethnics so the main victims here are Rakhine ethnics, not just Rohingya people alone. They are the weakest force here.

What happens now...

It is simple. Constitution grants 25% automatic congress seats to Military and you need 75% to change constitution. Military lost all the non-automatic seats so they are afraid of Civilian Government changing the constitution so they took action first by arresting the State Counsellor, the President and all the Congressmen. However, we have two Vice Presidents - one is installed by the Military and the other by Civilian Government.

President was held at gun point and asked to sign the State of Emergency. He rejected, saying they can kill him if they want but he won't sign. So, the Military's Vice President now became Acting President and he issued State of Emergency in the former's place (which is semi-legal) that grants Full Power to Military.

As for ASSK, Military hijacked her account and posted a message that tells every citizen to rise up in arms. Military arrested her under the clause ""Causing Civil Unrest"".

All the Congressmen are also arrested. I think they will be pressured to change the constitution for 50% automatic congress seats for Military.

About the international community, we don't expect much from them. They didn't help us ten years ago and they won't help us this time. As for the reasons, a few weeks ago China's Foreign Minister visited Myanmar. He talked with Military and will use Veto in United Nations to prevent foreign intervention. As for sanctions, they will only hurt the civilians and not Military. For example, if United States bans Myanmar's exports, the civilians will be helpless and unable to do anything. But Military will export them to Thailand, India, China, and perhaps even Russia. So the sanctions hold no effects except destabilising the country further.

^ Situation from a few days ago.

So you know what the Western Media feeds you is propaganda.

But in our country, Mabatha and Military preach ASSK as Muslim Whore because she built good houses for the relocated Rohingya people. By western standards, those houses might look shabby but they are made of concrete. You have to understand that Rakhine ethnics and many other ethnics live in shacks made of dried leaves.

A person can still defend genocide publicly while trying to prevent genocide privately. Moreover, if I were in her situation, I would do the same. Someone holds my family and country for hostage, I can defend genocide as many times as they want. Still, I will try my best to fight back privately."

Although ASSK said that those acts of human right violations will be ""addressed in accordance with strict norms of justice"", her government doesn't have any power over the military yet. It could be military's plan all along to destroy her international reputation so that they would have an easier coup now. 

And yes, there were even some Burmese who said stuff like ""those Rohingya should go back to where they come from"" or just stayed ignorant about that. Not only that, we have a lot of Burmese people who would generous victim blame, body shame, support sexual harassment, and not even aware of what they are doing.  All of this is a result of decades of military regime when the country was brought to its lowest on physical and moral grounds. 

Until recent years, I wasn't even aware of that my childhood textbook contained hate speech. And we just began to educate our countrymen for such ethics and moral issues and other civic initiatives.

Coverage of this in the Western media has been really interesting. Up to ten years ago, Rohingya were treated more or less like any other Muslim armed insurgent group. Groups of Bengalis were trying to take control of part of Myanmar. Terrible, but sectarian violence along a border is not exactly rare. Then, seemingly overnight, it became a genocide. Call me old fashioned, but one group winning a war is not genocide.

I'm not excusing the actions of the Burmese government or the Rohingya, but this is much more like the government fighting an outside, hostile force that was fighting them than a ""genocide."" It cheapens the word to call any kind of armed conflict along ethnic lines that."

Obviously they did, since the military had to murder and rape them to kick them out of the country. Oh and it was the government that denied the Rohingya citizenship in 1982.

So I think majority of us Burmese don't hate Muslims. And I personally hate that monk, he was such a disgrace to the image of Buddhism.

Of course not every single person, but that's the way war works. Two groups fight each other. Sometimes it's along ethnic lines, sometimes national, sometimes political, sometimes some other grouping. It's sad, and I wish war didn't exist, but when two groups of people are trying to kill the other group, civilian casualties happen. There have been flagrant excesses on both sides, but genocide is a ridiculous term for it.

How does giving enemy combatants citizenship solve your problem? It just gives them more power, restricts your ability to respond to their aggression, and prolongs the conflict.

You make it sound like they just took a wild hair to go mess with the Rohingya. This is part of a conflict that dates back to the 1940s in more or less its present form.

They have, and the sudden reinvention of the word genocide to describe war is one of the most interesting developments in the current politico-academic orthodoxy in the last 10 years.

Added to it their pro-longed global isolation and sudden exposure to social media, FB in particular (in Myanmar internet is synonymous with FB) magnified the discord within the society. Forces within the country who are inimical to democratic transition successfully exploited the global trends and pre-existing unresolved ethnic rivalries to achieve their dastardly objectives and continues to do so.

Tactical vs. Operational vs. Strategic level of war. You might be very proficient in the tactical level but perhaps not the other two levels.

If you think you can't win, then perhaps it's time to rethink the approach, one approach I already suggested: ""shut up and find way to survive and subvert the structure from the inside"". This is something I and my family has a lot of experience doing because despite living under a system many may think as intolerable, we have ways.

If you think that doing so is intolerable, then there's always the option of going out in a blaze of glory.

And to point out the simple reality at the strategic level: nobody outside Myanmar with enough leverage to do something will do anything; these are the Japanese and Singaporeans. There are others with no leverage who will pay lip service to the idea that ""this coup is bad, m'kay"".

>Additionally only a few people asked for US military intervention, most are just asking to spread information about this.

Everybody knows it already. It already achieved meme status. So that part is done. Yet like I said, nothing will be done. So, you can find a way to live on, or go out in a blaze of glory. And I'll say that the world's inactivity is justified: Myanmar serves no strategic interest to anyone, nor its people deserve help."
1314,lap93j,148,3,"I think your misunderstanding is that the civilian government never had any control or ability to coordinate any military action.  So when the term ""government"" is used, it is an error to equate that to the NLD civilian government which was under ASSK.  Although we would traditionally assume that the elected government would also hold some sway over military, that is decidedly not the case in Burma.  There the Tatmadaw has always acted independently."
1315,lap93j,150,3,"It is a strong statement from the UN, but it is inherently flawed as ASSK's government was always beholden to the military.  There was no room for independent manoeuvring."
1316,lap93j,151,1,"I would argue she decided not to use her political capital to press the Tatmadaw on this issue and instead tried to leverage her tacit agreement in exchange for support on the ceasefire agreement and/or constitutional reform. Not very successfully however.

Edit: meant capital, not potential."
1317,lap93j,152,3,"I agree that there likely was some attempt at leverage, but I am also doubtful of her political potential if she had decided to oppose the Tatmadaw.  ASSK is very popular in the country, but the Rohyingya issue is a minefield that even she would have had trouble navigating.  

Yes, by not speaking against the military she lost international credibility and the moral high ground, but both those things seemed a necessary trade for potential peace. 

What we witnessed was a clash between the idealized symbol of democratic hope, and a layered politician who found themselves trying to carve out political and economic stability in a deeply traumatized and fractured nation.  

In summary, I believe that the violence in Rhakine was solely engineered by the military.  The civilian government made ineffective attempts at peace, hamstrung by the military.  They did not speak out, especially in the latter parts of the crisis, so as to survive and hopefullyprevent the sad reality we now face. We can say it was immoral to not speak out against persecution, but the truth is a country that has only just caught a glimpse of freedom and security, can only afford to think of its immediate survival."

Myanmar should be a lesson for Chinese citizens. Prosperity without freedom, you risk to lose everything. Under the democratic government, although with very little power they had, Myanmar was moving towards prosperity. Once the guy at the top went and made a crazy move, the country turns into a failed state. It's not because of the Junta leader that Myanmar fails, it's the system. The bad system of allowing a dictator to have too much power. Allowing a dictator to control and command everything. So long as you have good dictators who make right decisions, things will be OK. But, once a bad one is in charge, people lose everything. That's because the system is set up that way.

It's even more worrying for China. If president Xi decides to wage war with the west and invades Taiwan, a lot of people could die. It's just his ambition and the legacy that he wants to leave as a guy who unites China but it will be at the expense of the prosperity and safety of Chinese people. Correct me if I am wrong, currently Chinese citizens, even for a little, cannot criticize the CCP or PLA or even the police -- essentially people have no power against their government. Look at Jack Ma, relatively powerful man with huge wealth, CCP can take it away from him overnight.

And, Myanmar citizens know that what CCP says in front of the world and the media is not what they do. There is no transparency. They say no intervention but both Russia and China are selling weapons to the Myanmar fascist military without any care for the ordinary citizen."

Wouldn't those shield be worse? When a bullet hits one, the metal ripped apart and sends metal scraps towards the shield holder. If the military or police uses a shotgun, that's even worse because now you have metal shards along with it. 

It'll work on polices without guns, but I'm not sure if it's better if they have guns. 

What they need to do is not to fight head on. It's hard to win head on if you don't have guns and your enemies have way superior weapons. Brute forcing would result in a lot of death.

The alternative way would be to use guerrilla tactics, It doesn't matter if the tactics is petty either. You fighting a military dictatorship, use everything in your power to achieve your goal.

They need to use some kind of pepper-spray projectiles, even if it's primitive. Pepper powder should be accessible. (I don't know if this would work but maybe pepper powder covered in cloth? so when thrown it sort of explodes?)

For range, perhaps a slingshot or a sling could help. Mix that with some kind of pepper projectiles and hurl them towards the enemy.

Bows would work, but are difficult to make. Especially the arrow part as I assume that only arrows with a metal head could pierce modern armor vest.

Avoiding direct combat is probably the best choice as well, or there will be too much casualties. 

The other way would be to use cruel tactics. Somehow poison the polices or military water and food supply, use loud speakers (if you get one) and play loud gun firing sounds at nights to keep them mentally drained, and etc."

The 1.3m tall shield that are resistant against rifle rounds (lv III) weights 19.5kg. 

If you lug around such shields, sure, the army can't hit you from a distance from the front, but you also can't run away fast enough. Close enough and they can easily flank you and shoot from the side. Or they could always bring up an APC, use 7.62 mm AP rounds or 40mm grenades.

The formation also had very little offensive capabilities to counter a charge or hold out in a melee.

Real bullets or even just stun grenades would likely break it very quickly and because of its relatively complicated nature it would be difficult to reorganise it under duress.

‚ÄúWe love you guys keep fighting!‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to stop a 5.56 round from going through someone‚Äôs skull. Send fucking money, supplies, or something tangible."
1398,lz10do,71,17,"Nah, those sheet metals do nothing against even 9mm rounds."
1399,lz10do,72,8,Or create deadly shrapnel
1400,lz10do,73,5,Narrator: It didn't do shit against lethal munitions.
1401,lz10do,76,8,"I don't think it's supposed to be used against live rounds. It's supposed to be used against rubber bullets and baton charges, which it looks effective."
1402,lz10do,78,0,You think they give a shit? It‚Äôs good propaganda when you can blame fallen soldiers on protestors.
1403,lz10do,79,2,You‚Äôre comparing 1 AR with the army. Now compare the entire population who owns guns with the army.
1404,lz10do,80,1,"I‚Äôd much rather have a firearm than be facing down oppression with a tin shield. Along with the rest of an armed population standing against tyranny.     
Not charging in, but can certainly hold your ground a lot more efficiently.     
Better to be armed than completely defenseless no matter the scenario"
1405,lz10do,81,1,"> The fact you think your ar15 will help against the United States Army shows a big lack of combat experience lol. What's gonna actually get results is smarts in a situation like this. Not America first charging your gun.

Tell me again why is America still fighting the Taliban? Clearly you don‚Äôt know what your talking about."
1406,lz10do,82,1,"> I saw another video of police just spraying water and tear gas. This will work against that. The shooting has started but it‚Äôs not the norm (or there would be hundreds or thousands dead by now). The military can‚Äôt be too brutal or it‚Äôll invite a foreign army which they‚Äôre not equipped to fight against.

True. But at the same time this ain‚Äôt America or China. People are trying to emulate Hong Kong but forget that the World was watching Chinas actions very closely. Myanmar on the other hand has no one watching them. They banned Social Media. I‚Äôm amazed to see even any videos surface on the internet."
1407,lz10do,87,1,"'Fight for your freedom!' Eats a bag of chips. Complains they don't have enough flavour

Its the perspective of privilege. It lacks real consequence but feels like serotonin"
1408,lz10do,89,6,Also saw some demonstrators using their own shield wall to break police lines and cause chaos amongst their rank. Its obviously not a magic bullet but it works damn well if applied correctly. Noone on the ground is foolish enough to belive a thin metal board will protect them from live fire. Especially considering that most of these folks in the video were probably being shot at not even a day prior to this.
1409,lz10do,90,0,"I've seen videos of protestors elsewhere knowing snipers were shooting at them ran out with plywood ""shields"" to know that not everyone gets what is or isn't a ""cover"".

I also see them lying prone on street to make themselves a smaller target I guess but I suppose they also don't quite get that bullets fired and impact hard surfaces like paved road ricochet and skips along the surface. They could still get hit in the face or other vital areas lying down that way.

Once rifles are the riot suppression tool, ok funs and games are over. Time to stop and do something else."
1410,lz10do,93,3,"Even if every single citizen has a gun, that rifle round won‚Äôt bring down a F22. Or an M1 tank. And how much ammo do you think civilians have access to? Only a small minority can stockpile enough ammo to last a war and if a war breaks out, the government would have all the means of production. You can‚Äôt really fight a war with small arms. Not against an industrialized superpower. 

But this is ignoring the fact that soldiers won‚Äôt kill their own people and citizens are very unlikely to get organized enough to actually fight their governments. If anything, it‚Äôs going to be small militia factions vs the government and the population in the crossfire like every other attempt to overthrow a government."
1411,lz10do,94,1,Yeah. It'd take less then 10% of their resources to wipe you and anyone with you away in seconds.
1412,lz10do,96,0,"America is at ""war"" with Isis but lets them go free on the populace once they're no longer interested in that specific area. Free and angry mind you as all the citizens supported the Americans until they left them to be butchered over political disinterest."
1413,lz10do,97,1,Because they invade countries constantly without legal justification and are more terrorists there then anything else. Protecting their assets isn't the same as fighting a war..
1414,lz10do,99,2,"They actually don‚Äôt have the type of control over social media like Mainland China does. They‚Äôve shut off the internet at night but it‚Äôs not exclusively social media. We‚Äôre watching, it‚Äôs just not America‚Äôs ally or sphere of influence. If anyone is doing anything it would be China except the protesters are including themselves with Taiwan or Hong Kong which could be a bad thing for them."

1416,lz10do,101,-6,"People ‚Äúlike him‚Äù in this world are fucking useless in a war. Virtual thoughts and prayers do fuck-all when you‚Äôre up against machine guns, tanks, and overall annihilation."
1417,lz10do,102,1,Who told you that the ccp? Cause I know borders who went to my high-school that either didn‚Äôt know about it or knew little truth and were afraid of discussing or delving farther into the topic. Maybe the Chinese talk about it in school but I doubt it‚Äôs an unbiased account.
1418,lz10do,103,0,"And what do they teach? So they teach that it was a bunch of unarmed students and professors who wanted better treatment and representation? Or do they teach that they were anarchists trying to destroy the Chinese way of life?

Propaganda is subtle and a slight reframing can change the whole meaning."
1419,lz10do,106,1,Why we still fighting the Taliban then if it‚Äôs so impossible to fight the US army with just an AK
1420,lz10do,107,2,Why would america go through the process of wiping out a good amount of its population? You‚Äôre not thinking rationally.
1421,lz10do,108,2,Why is your beta ass so scared of guns. üòÇ You don't even live in a free country so why do you think your opinion matters at all.
1422,lz10do,110,5,"Okay, so what do you expect us to do? Drop everything we have in the States - our families, our college degrees, our whole fucking *lives* - to go put ourselves in the line of fire in a country that we can't even afford a one-way plane ticket to?

Look, I sympathize and empathize with the protestors, but it's because they have ***no other choice but to protest because fascists with machine guns are in their front yard***. But I should go bankrupt flying to Southeast Asia and abandon all my responsibilities and opportunities so I can ""really"" support the cause. Definitely.

You may not like it, but simply signal boosting and showing our support *is the most we can do*, and it's better than nothing."
1423,lz10do,112,1,"Imagine thinking the USA is actually fighting the Taliban and not just protecting their interests when necessary and ignoring them otherwise.
Remember what country let thousands of Isis prisoners walk out of the jails because they where finished there. Just last year too lmfao"
1424,lz10do,113,1,I'm waiting for the day I meet an American who actually knows something about their country on a international level. Your America is the greatest attitude is why you're treated like shit in most countries lmfao. America is the greatest at screwing with its own citizens and not getting in trouble
1425,lz10do,115,1,Why would this country? Yet we're watching it.
1426,lz10do,116,1,And honestly if we're comparing morals America's known globally for blood not peace. So it lines up way closer then you'd think lol. Heck we saw some potentially close situations just last year no?
1427,lz10do,117,0,"Lmfao what's a free country exactly? A ""democracy"" where you have people storming your nations capital to stop a elected president from taking office? Or one where most children have to learn how to hide from a gunman as it's a real and probable threat.  
Or is it about laws the kind that normally get made by one dude signing exec orders? You're the perfect example of an American you know nothing about your country yet think it's better than others.  Y'all can't even do basic measurements at the world stage many would call that undeveloped.

You don't even vote in your own president you just suggest to your electors who they should vote for."
1428,lz10do,118,2,That's fuckin nuts. Explains the more mass shootings then days of the year thing you guys got going on. Yes multiple rounds could probably easily do it especially if you got the accuracy time and they just let y'all shoot while they finger their asses.
1429,lz10do,119,-4,"Shut upppp. Literally no one asked for your sob story excuses. 

Either donate supplies/money, travel there to provision on-site aid, or stfu. Posting sympathetic garbage for upvotes on a Reddit board achieves virtually n o t h i n g.

1431,lz10do,122,3,"No lol, I need a reminder. I don‚Äôt recall any time when the military killed a large percent of the population. Except for wounded knee, which was what happened when the military tried to disarm the population. Now imagine that but 50x as large. Not gonna happen."

1435,lz10do,126,5,"Also, to make everything crystal clear for you: I have no money. No transport. So you telling me to shut the fuck up when this is all I can do at the moment is actually kind of messed up. Whatever. Say and do what you want, I get it‚Äôs hard over there and you are angry."
1436,lz10do,127,1,The us isn't fighting the Taliban they're protecting interests not acting in the interests of war. So yeah of course the Taliban still exist your initial comment was based off incorrect information
1437,lz10do,128,1,"They're using small amounts of resources to do small jobs relating to Taliban activities that's about it.
Not at all like a military using reserve Forces and all its weapons and tech that are already in the country they'd be fighting in. The comparison makes 0 real points"
1438,lz10do,129,1,Jesus you know it's a weak argument when you gotta stalk the guys page and use the only Reddit post he made to try and discredit him.
1439,lz10do,130,1,They've killed a large precent of many countries populations? Take your pick. Just because you have had it happen internally doesn't mean you won't. Unless you're seriously going to say America's stable and non violent these days.
1440,lz10do,131,1,Y'all commited some of the worst recorded war crimes especially since WW2 with little to no justification and still let those soliders go free with immunity. So like again not the moral high ground
1441,lz10do,132,1,You're pretty uneducated in human behaviour if you seriously think your neighbors are as capable as you claim. I'm sure you spend lots of time in the range and think you're combat ready yet never fired a shot under duress playing games at home isn't war it's not even close.

1527,lwdpr1,83,2,I think the later one are the worst tbf.
1528,lwdpr1,84,1,Ask the parents of the person who died like this about what the difference is
1529,lwdpr1,85,1,"Just going along with it is like ‚Äújust following orders‚Äù. It excuses what they did. And how many of them are there, hundreds, thousands? You don‚Äôt have time to have a trial for every single person"
1530,lwdpr1,87,2,"There is a major flaw in our judicial system, one of which is misogyny alongside others like homophobia and religious intolerance but we know it gets better"
1531,lwdpr1,88,0,"Please, enlighten us about your knowledge of British Burma, the repercussions when the government decided to leave our great commonwealth. I doubt you comprehend our history,  you gormless berk. Have you ever travelled to Burma, experienced the Secretariat, witnessed the rundown exquisite British constructions yourself?"
1532,lwdpr1,89,1,"Those are his tools.

Hilter got his tools too. U don't attack your own tools. So that cancelled out.

I may be wrong in my views as i didnt compared the scale of destruction and the duration.

But all these aside, MAH uses his tools all attack all the civilians. And how many stand with him?

And he does it within a month. And u imagine he has the military might like Hilter then and started WW3? Don't u think he's worse than Hilter? Remember... ALL except his tools. (Or fools)

This is a discussion. U dont have to agree with me. And anyone can have their opinion that Hilter is worse than MAH considered the things he had done.

But my opinion is that MAH is worse than Hilter"
1533,lwdpr1,90,1,"Peiple of nation he seized are not his people. And not all the german citizen. Just the j.... well. Nevermind.

You didnt get it and clearly are offended.

Last i remembered i apologise twice. I'll leave it because his sub is for myanmar citizen."
1534,lwdpr1,91,-1,"Oh my god..... another who dont get it?

When i asked who he tortured i dont mean he didnt tortured. I just want u to focus that he didnt torture ALL GERMEN CITIZEN.

Unlike MAH who attacked all civilian citizen.

And in your hypotectical example, at least the invaded ""represents"" the country and for the people. Thou not all the people. But at least some will be for.

Unlike MAH who attacked his own people. 

So i am giving a comparison that MAH is worse than Hilter.

u wanna start a vote? % of German who hate Hilter vs % or Burmese who hate MAH

I rest my case."
1535,lwdpr1,92,1,"I don‚Äôt disagree, but personally I don‚Äôt see them as imminent threats or instigators, so a long long prison sentence where they are forced to rethink their actions is far more punishment than a quick death would be. And that‚Äôs what I think should happen to people that just go along with it."
1536,lwdpr1,93,2,Misogyny is one of the big issues in Myanmar also.
1537,lwdpr1,94,3,"I just meant I don't know that your earlier comment meant anything. All dictators have ""their people"" or tools, so saying ""at least Hitler looked after his people"" doesn't mean much and does not make him a good leader. If civilians were protesting on the streets in Germany, I doubt that Hitler would have hesitated over using live ammunition. He'd have anyone standing nearby shot no matter who they were. 

MAH isn't even worse than previous military dictators in the history of Myanmar. He's no worse than Saw Maung during 8888. MAW is not unique in his evil."
1538,lwdpr1,95,1,He tortured and killed any citizen that didn‚Äôt like what Hitler enforced
1539,mfnr2h,1,87,This is happening in once a glorified capital city of Myanmar. Military will just kill people and destroy all big cities if they are allowed to. Saddest part is UN will be making statements after statements.
1540,mfnr2h,2,66,It is more like 40mm grenade. And given that asking for help in Myanmar sub will not going well. Especially because this is reddit. Keep going buddy stay safe.

1543,mfnr2h,9,7,"At this point your only hope is to find family members of people on the military, after all they did kill and plan to continue killing yours. The people who joined the military are usually citizens of a country, why are they doing this to their own people? There are no rules, no common decency. Storm the compounds at night and start stick knives in their necks. They‚Äôre gonna kill you anyway."
1544,mfnr2h,11,5,Don't expect the U.S to help. It's corrupt to its core and the old fucks running the show are so fucking senile that they won't do anything unless it's to fight communists like during the cold war.

It would be good to capture some prisoners..but it will need training and timing.Dont be an easy target for these killers."
1546,mfnr2h,16,2,I never been so angry. Fire at civilians with grenades! The Us should fire a tomahork missiles at the top liders of that repressive regime!
1547,mfnr2h,17,2,What is the end game here? Armed uprising? General strike?
1548,mfnr2h,18,2,How can we even help?
1549,mfnr2h,21,8,The US is NOT getting involved in this. Don't rely on a foreign country to come in and save Myanmar because it won't happen.
1550,mfnr2h,22,5,"This is basically a Chinese invasion of Myanmar using the Tatmadaw to do the dirty work. Now it's time to see what the Quad, 5 Eyes and EU are really made of. Exactly how many countries are they prepared to let CCP invade before they take some serious action. There are a coalition of 10 ethnic armies in Myanmar waiting for the west to send supplies and support them with airstrikes. China is basically invading the world and have met no serious opposition. The world is going to have to declare war on China sooner or later or face being CCP slaves for the next 1000 years."
1551,mfnr2h,24,2,"Damn, I wish y'all had the 2nd amendment üòû"
1552,mfnr2h,25,1,we should be arming the rebels with every weapon imaginable to take on the army. F what China and Russia thinks.

1555,mfnr2h,34,1,In Rambo 4 Myanmar military is really brutal  if they really do the shits they did in that movie they really need UN peacekeepers
1556,mfnr2h,35,1,"Its 100% not an RPG. RPG rocket would have annihilated them, most likely it is a 40mm grenade from M203 or GP-25 under barrle grenade launcher or a simple fragmentation grenade."
1557,mfnr2h,37,1,"I can't understand why the UN, EU and other domestic countries do nothing till now. When will they take concrete action to save Myanmar people?"
1558,mfnr2h,38,1,"I‚Äôve heard some rumors that an organization in cambodia is trying to smuggle weapons accross the borders. Like I‚Äôve said there rumors and im sure, but let‚Äôs have an open mind"
1559,mfnr2h,39,1,"How cruel and dehumanizing the events in Myanmar (Burma) really have been over time. This is never new at all, because the brutality has been endless since the beginnings of modern Myanmar many years ago."

1561,mfnr2h,42,1,Fucking cowards
1562,mfnr2h,44,1,Some say its karma for the Rohingya genocide a few years back
1563,mfnr2h,46,5,"its seems that it is bomb

rpg or grenade or grenade by langher 

this is civil war

citizen side stay strong"
1564,mfnr2h,48,39,Yeah! They always worry about us and do nothing
1565,mfnr2h,49,3,"hope that NATO can help but the Allies are too weak..

also i remember that the military regime had forced children to go through the mine field for gambling.."
1566,mfnr2h,51,57, it seem like grenade launcher.I'm not expert in weapons so it might be wrong. My people are dying. I have to do something to get help even it's less possible.
1567,mfnr2h,52,10,Bro I also think it is some kind of grenade and if it is RPG it would blast all. The later news also says it‚Äôs a grenade how do you think.
1568,mfnr2h,54,1,"some info are useful

i have reminded person to look out sniper from high ground 

just like the Thailand revolution

then the regime really snipe good guys from high ground 

sadly my message cannot be delivered before the shot cuz the military regime had blocked the internet at those days.."
1569,mfnr2h,57,6,this is unfair!
1570,mfnr2h,58,44,"We use bow,home made smoke bomb,molotov cocktail. That's all.We don't have any other weapon. So,Our people are being killed and i'm asking help here like a crazy üò≠üò≠"
1571,mfnr2h,60,-15,Their main tactic seems to be crouching behind things and running around.
1572,mfnr2h,61,12,Yes!! They also used that. We didn't have a chance to take evidence.
1573,mfnr2h,64,0,They can fight their own fight but we should be giving them weapons
1574,mfnr2h,66,6,"Not Burmese, but from what I understand the military in Myanmar is, by design, very culturally secluded from the rest of the population. They have been conditioned to see citizens as inhuman, and encouraged to commit atrocities."
1575,mfnr2h,69,1,"But the government isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong, it‚Äôs the military."
1576,mfnr2h,70,2,Dude the US government are probably the ones who helped fund and orchestrate this coup.
1577,mfnr2h,76,1,"Basically bad guys with guns, ah more like machine guns and portable rocket launchers with purpose to kill. I bet if they had nuke, idiots won‚Äôt hesitate to use on own people."
1578,mfnr2h,81,4,"And even if they did, people would just complain about them being involved."

1580,mfnr2h,85,-4,">This is basically a Chinese invasion of Myanmar using the Tamadaw to do the dirty work

Can Americans learn to spell things correctly before jumping into conspiracy theories."
1581,mfnr2h,86,1,How many Hail Mary‚Äôs until something actually happens? Otherwise you talking to yourself in your head does about as much good as me typing this comment
1582,mfnr2h,87,-15,"Lol, get the fuck out of here with your prayers. You‚Äôre so useless for society"
1583,mfnr2h,89,4,"The city of Klay, where most ethics people live generally, they have home made rifles to fight back, the military declared war on them yesterday."
1584,mfnr2h,92,16,Stop trying to make this about your hard-on for murder dildos. It's video proof of what happens when you have a military with no civilian control who is allowed to maintain economic interests and interfere in politics for over 70 years.
1585,mfnr2h,94,-2,"I mean even if guns are allowed, Myanmar will become America and there will be more people die"
1586,mfnr2h,95,3,"This one seem like grenade launcher.At first i think it's RPG.Sorry,it's my fault.But I heard the news that Military also try to use RPG in Dawei.I have some photos"
1587,mfnr2h,96,2,"It's our faults.We already apologized them.We only
 listened fake news that Military released and ignored Rohingya's problem.We regret for not standing with Rohingya."
1588,mfnr2h,97,1,What's your point? So you're on the junta side then? The same terrorists that killed the Rohingya that you so woefully empathize for? Take your bitterness and get out the door.
1589,mfnr2h,98,10,Lol stupid no need to explain for this kind of nonsense comment.
1590,mfnr2h,99,2,It's interesting how much tankies love defending authoritarian regimes all over the world even when they aren't pretending to be socialist like china
1591,mfnr2h,100,1,"You commies really enjoy demonstrating your ""love"" for the proletariat, huh?"
1592,mfnr2h,101,1,i wish they could but they have no guns and the troops do. not really much they can do except a fighting retreat which is what is going on basically
1593,mfnr2h,111,2,"An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind, cycles of perpetual violence are for wild animals."
1594,mfnr2h,112,14,Definitely too low yield to be an RPG. Looks more like a 40mm. Still incredibly lethal and should not be used against CIVILLIANS
1595,mfnr2h,114,18,They are funded by big donations so they have to at least act like they are working by making useless statements.
1596,mfnr2h,115,7,yall know theyre a scam
1597,mfnr2h,117,2,Only thing the UN worries about is it's reputation.
1598,mfnr2h,119,2,Not NATO‚Äôs responsibility. Ask your buddy China.
1599,mfnr2h,123,9,"There will also be people in the comments who do not care or say that you deserve it, something about karma and so on, I know that they are wrong, I know that you are offended to hear this, but please ignore them. It will not help anyone to argue with them."
1600,mfnr2h,126,4,"Yeah, I feel like an RPG would‚Äôve taken out that entire crowd. The shrapnel produced can cause lethal damage from up to a football field away (‚âà100 meters). We *have* seen evidence of junta soldiers equipped with RPGs though. Never give up!"
1601,mfnr2h,128,13,"Fights like these aren't about whats going on in the streets, get at their armory, ambush soldiers on breaks and take their gear."
1602,mfnr2h,129,12,How does the ethnic factions get guns?
1603,mfnr2h,133,1,"You guys need to get your hands on guns, whatever it takes."
1604,mfnr2h,136,5,"The main tactic is protesting.  

What would you do if protesting and suddenly received an inbound 40micmic and bullet snaps?

This is not a country with a lot of civilian guns so if your answer is some sort of larpy American bullshit, it's still a dumb answer because step one is always look for cover.  As they did.

Bellend"
1605,mfnr2h,137,1,"That is the problem. If they don‚Äôt do the same, or worse to their families they won‚Äôt stop. If the militaries families were among the people they were murdering it would be a different story. That‚Äôs why in US we don‚Äôt have this fear. I was one of the soldiers for 4 years, but one of the people my whole life"
1606,mfnr2h,139,-4,What kind of retarded thing is that supposed to mean?
1607,mfnr2h,140,2,They can complain afterwards. I think Americans are stronger than a few words of complains anyways.
1608,mfnr2h,142,2," What exactly do you suggest is a conspiracy theory? Oh, and I'm not American."
1609,mfnr2h,143,3,"Idk this guy and I‚Äôm agnostic but fuck you religion is just a means of hope. let them have that a least, they need all the hope they can get."
1610,mfnr2h,144,7,Almost every free country in the world achieved their freedom through violence.
1611,mfnr2h,145,1,So who fights back against the military when they're out of control?
1612,mfnr2h,146,-7,"Huh? Civilians having guns is necessary for situations like this. People will still do bad things with guns, yes."
1613,mfnr2h,147,2,doubt it.
1614,mfnr2h,149,-2,"The thing is, it wasn‚Äôt just the military on that. It‚Äôs a proven fact who caused the genocide."
1615,mfnr2h,155,2,Humans are wild animals
1616,mfnr2h,156,20,Any useful statements would be blocked by China and Russia.
1617,mfnr2h,157,3,"it is not about big donation from big country 

it is about un is always blocked by putin"
1618,mfnr2h,159,1,go back to russia
1619,mfnr2h,162,11,"I know! It's also our fault to ignore about Rohingya case. We have to pay for them. So,we are trying to win this fight. If we win this fight,we will call back them and give back their home and peace life."
1620,mfnr2h,164,2,"People greatly misunderstand RPGs, how they work, and the different variants.

The [common RPG](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG-7) warhead that we think of is intended to great a thin, molten arrow of liquid metal to pierce armor. These typically kill by direct impacts of the molten metal. They are not designed to create shrapnel or concussive waves, that would be taking away from its main purpose of piercing armor. In the Army, we were trained to keep a couple of feet away from solid surfaces like walls to minimize the threat of the common RPGs. These types of grenades can easily punch a hole in a wall without killing the people outside or inside the building.

[This is one example of an Anti-personnel variant.](https://kintex.bg/product-4-146) These are the people killers and are highly effective."
1621,mfnr2h,166,1,"This is a Military killing civilians for peaceful protesting, what do you think they would do if they were to be attacked and robbed?"
1622,mfnr2h,167,3,"‡∏∫Bought from another country. China supply weapons to ethnic group they support and there have been reort of some ethnic group acquired MANPADS made in China since 2019.  


Aloso, there is a weapon smuggling busted in Thailand recently."
1623,mfnr2h,168,19,"We also search and make home made weapons. But if soldiers catch that,they'll kill us.That why we need to be careful. Anyway thank you for your advise."
1624,mfnr2h,170,3,"While violence is always the last and worst solution, if it is what becomes needed to protect yourself and those your love, please skip the *Anarchist Cookbook*. The information in it is unreliable. Go for documents such as the [TM 31-210 Improvised Munitions Handbook](https://elaineou.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/improvised-munitions-handbook.pdf) and [TM-31-201-1 Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques: Incendiaries](https://www.militarynewbie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/TM-31-201-1.pdf). Hopefully the information in such manuals can help with using the least amount of force possible to provide for your own safety in the face of such atrocities.  


For personal safety, don't condone violence, etc. Jesus, laws are goddamned ridiculous these days. I'm sick of seeing what we're doing to each other."
1625,mfnr2h,171,5,that is horrible advice...
1626,mfnr2h,172,7,"That‚Äôs just a misinformed propaganda statement. Look it up, the new president is not my favorite person but it‚Äôs very important to research his actual plans before repeating what you hear. He wishes to strengthen gun laws to reduce mentally ill massacres and things like grenade launchers on the streets. There has been nothing in his statements that can be translated to ‚Äúwants to take guns away‚Äù"
1627,mfnr2h,174,1,"No. Quite on the contrary, it would give the government an excuse to use even greater violence. The southern union had guns, that did not automatically make them win."
1628,mfnr2h,175,-2,"Ok, so i just shot you in the chest with a high powered , fully automatic rifle... now you do your molotov attack..."
1629,mfnr2h,178,-3,LARPers would stand a better chance than these muppets.

1632,mfnr2h,181,-1,"Lol, then why do you volunteer the US for military actions? At least have the decency to show what your country is before advocating for war, and be ready to go for it."
1633,mfnr2h,183,1,And every country that denies their citizens freedom does it through violence.
1634,mfnr2h,185,9,"You literally didn't comprehend what I said.

You have plenty of opportunity to use your guns for good. Where were you during BLM? Where's the wall of 2nd Ammendment people with their guns fighting to save the kids in prisons on our border?"
1635,mfnr2h,186,9,Wow brainwashed commie.
1636,mfnr2h,188,5,You‚Äôre an idiot. The millions of people protesting all over Myanmar are not being paid by anyone.
1637,mfnr2h,189,3,"I would be more careful to who I would categorise as a moron in your place, especially when you're one."
1638,mfnr2h,190,1,"If the CIA was helping, they would have guns by now"
1639,mfnr2h,192,17,"A purpose which in and of itself makes the UN largely redundant.  

EXCEPT by preventing escalation of conflicts between the West and the Russians and China.  

The UN may not get shit done but it does reduce bad shit being done.   We all like to rag on it being useless here but those Russian and Chinese vetos have probably helped us avoid conflicts"
1640,mfnr2h,193,2,Also China as well. How could they say it's all internal affair?
1641,mfnr2h,195,11,"I read that most did not know the real situation at that time. This is the fault of the military. And those children who are now being killed definitely can not have done anything then.

If the military suppresses the protests, they will go for Karen and Rohingya next.

Just ignore such comments. I think that some of these comments are written by people who are paid for it."
1642,mfnr2h,196,1,"They're already going door to door and killing people they suspect, their families and their children. I don't see how it could get much worse. Life is worth fighting for.

Is your suggestion they submit to the military and deal with it?"
1643,mfnr2h,197,11,"Aside from putting me on a list for reading, this is NOT an easy thing to make.  Pure red fuming nitric and pure fuming sulfuric acid are hardly common things at the Myanmar stores

Let's be real, probably way easier to source some shitty AKMs from thailand/laos/nam/cambodia"
1644,mfnr2h,198,1,"Reduce things like grenade launchers on the streets? 

1. How many grenade launchers were used in murders last year in the US?

2. How would a 30 round magazine ban, ""assault weapons"" ban, or background checks for private party sales prevent the grenade launcher murder epidemic you propose exists?"
1645,mfnr2h,199,1,This exchange is not very interesting.
1646,mfnr2h,200,1,So give up weapons and hope government doesn‚Äôt hurt you. No thanks
1647,mfnr2h,201,0,Oh you didn't trigger me. You triggered an FBI watchlist.
1648,mfnr2h,202,3,"Yeh, I suspected he was a wumao as soon as he assumed I was American. Perhaps he doesn't realise that the whole world is waking up to the criminal CCP despots, not just Americans."
1649,mfnr2h,204,3,Which is why civilians need guns.
1650,mfnr2h,205,1,"With what? Sticks, rocks, and fireworks won't defeat a military. It takes guns, which is literally the entire point of our 2A"
1651,mfnr2h,207,-4,I don't think that border kids or BLM is worth a violent revolution. Sorry.
1652,mfnr2h,208,2,"Yeah, avoid conflicts while, CCP quietly invade the planet using UN to block any intervention. CCP are very keen to send PLA to Myanmar in the guise of UN peacekeepers to protect their interests and personnel while they carry on with their invasion of the world resigning democracy to a museum next to the bones of some dinosaurs."
1653,mfnr2h,210,1,"No, but I DO suggest not ambushing the military, that will only end in more bloodshed."
1654,mfnr2h,213,-1,Except I never post there. I assume you are American because you act like your country has the military power to back it up. But you are just volunteering sons from someone else's families.
1655,mfnr2h,215,1,"Your guns also won't defeat a military no matter how much you wish that was true. They have tanks, grenades, mortars, drones, fighter jets, attack helicopters, RPGs, gunships, etc."
1656,mfnr2h,216,8,"So again, don't tread on me. You don't care if they tread on anyone else but yourself. You're not heroes."
1657,mfnr2h,217,7,"Hugs for you. I would like to put a heart, but I do not know how to do it."
1658,mfnr2h,218,1,"Any action of any sort will end in more bloodshed. Watching kids with bows and arrows ""protesting"" in the street get hit by a military 40mm seems less productive than taking up guerilla tactics."
1659,mfnr2h,219,1,"Yeah, thanks for the information, now fuck off ya blabbering fool and go and spout your gibberish at someone else."
1660,mfnr2h,220,1,"Or maybe i could just block you, cause your a complete waste of time."
1661,mfnr2h,224,2,"Yes, but it is not so pretty."
1662,mfnr2h,225,-2,I think we should send most of them back to Honduras or Mexico.
1663,mfnr2h,226,6,Well I think you should go back to Poland or Germany or wherever you came from. Cause unless you're Mexican or indigenous it wasn't here.

Is it true democracy if the religious leaders pick the candidates?! Iran is the one supplying the Houthis with weapons‚Äî the same Houthis who started the war. Iran has troops in Syria defending the chemical weapon using genocidal maniac Assad. Iran also funds terrorism through the Middle East such as hezbollah. Iran has frequently threatened to nuke or bomb Israel.

No relevance to anything here. Morales wanted to become a dictator and had the police be brutal on protestors. He was kicked out and police then beat up the new protesters. New elections were held and far right government isn‚Äôt in power.

But of course you want to defend Evo since he tried to become dictator Putin style. He ignored referendums and had his stacked courts Eliminate term limits so he can rule forever.

Bolivian people made their choice, and it's not the American government's right to interfere with Bolivia's domestic affair.

I know very little about what's happening in Myanmar right now besides the fact that the army took control and there is now a civil war in some regions. Can anybody explain a little bit more what the situation is like? Is the fighting restricted to specific regions only? Does the new military 'government' have much support at all (I hope not after seeing these pictures..)."

1838,12idltl,117,3,"For no reason is not an objective statement whatsoever. You are saying that a commander one day ordered to blast the village for ‚Äúno reason‚Äù? They pull out the plane from hanger, arranged the bombs, fueled the plane, and go out in the wild ride and decided to a bomb random village for ‚Äùno reason‚Äù? Why does the strike happens just now and not in the past or future? Why this place out of many other places to conduct a strike? There are many questions left to answer and it is definitely not a ‚Äúno reason‚Äù. And unlike other massacres and crimes they have committed before, this doesn‚Äôt work like this because in order for an airstrike to happen, you need multiple chains of command to order such decisions whereas the usual gun/on-ground crimes can be committed by any privates in the army. Still if they are just innocent civilians, then i feel very sorry for them. It could have been an misjudgment of the striking location as well."

1846,12idltl,132,3,"I don't think BSH has been the most diplomatic in his language here, but he is fundamentally correct: if you live under a junta that massacres people with airstrikes, don't hold large gatherings for them to target.

Saying that local authorities should avoid having people crowd together so that one bomb can cause a mass casualty event is not absolving the bombers or their commanders of the crime in any way.

Plus, based upon the Junta response I read on the BBC, this is not ""collateral damage""; the Junta targeted this even deliberately."
1847,12idltl,133,0,"I am not blaming the civilians who got killed there. The people are eager to stop the decade-long military oppression, and they'll try to show support to NUG or any anti-coup groups operating in their area any chance they get. I'm holding whoever from the administrative body that organised the event accountable. May their soul rest in peace if they were among the victims, but seriously? It's not rocket science to know it's not an appropriate time and place when the fascist military won't think twice to kill anyone regardless of their gender and age if they're deemed involved with the resistance. 

True, ceremony or not, airstrikes are inevitable, you can't expect any better from a genocidal institution that burn down churches and shoot kids who're playing in their own houses. That's why we can't afford to do any mistakes let alone something this ignorant. Lives are at stake ffs."
1848,12idltl,134,1,"Did you not read my reply above? I'm NOT blaming the dead civilians. I'm criticising whoever approved that ceremony. 

I'm sick of ""NUG can do no wrong"" attitude of people. Calling out their bs is not victim blaming for they are not fucking victims."
1849,12idltl,135,1,"Honestly, it makes me more pissed because the military had no reason to shell a remote village no one's heard of out of no where. If it weren't for the ceremony, this could've been avoided. They underestimated SAC because the place is remote and under control when the same thing had happened in Kachin like five months ago."
1850,12idltl,137,3,Women with their pants/skirts pulled down and people who looked like they were cut open. Those are sure signs edit: it‚Äôs probably that the clothes were burnt off by the explosion nvm
1851,12idltl,138,4,"Ok yeah, it looks like I got the wrong idea. There are women with no pants here, so I assumed the worst, but it‚Äôs probably that they were burnt off by the explosion. Still horrible, but my mistake. I didn‚Äôt mean to misrepresent anything so I deleted my comment"

If you don't know this they bomb with plane a lot to citizens
One time it was very big
They bomb the people that are celebrating their culture

Whenever They lost the ground battle they do this

They target citizens if they can't fight the rebel 

If you're a local you will understand their psychological reasons behind this

Also for your information
The whole country is very devastated because of this
Everyone is crying

This is not an easy thing to let them pass"

Those are just verbal cover for pursuing cold-blooded national interests. Intervention on Myanmar is a non-starter. Countries around Myanmar vehemently oppose military intervention and Myanmar's military is also much stronger than the militaries in Central America and Middle East that the West is accustomed to fighting.

1860,12idltl,155,5,"Actually they've been targetting any non majority (Bamar) for a long long time (including but not limited to the Rohingya). They do oppress the Bamar majority as well, but only recently have they gone full out resulting in the current conflict/atrocities."

1863,12idltl,159,-1,"I am not very convinced by your reasoning yet. It has quite a lot of fallacies and speculations. And iirc, the last time they tried to bomb the a celebration, it was held by the resistance correct? For the ‚Äúthey target civilians if they don‚Äôt win‚Äù i will say it does happen from time to time on the ground by undisciplined commanders and soldiers, but i am not convinced they would literally use the air-force as a way to conduct war crimes. If this event were to happen without the air-strike part, i would be inclined to believe that it would be a massacre. However it is not so, i believe it is either a mistake or something else. I don‚Äôt want to continue arguing because my opinions are also based on speculations as well. Might as well wait some time for proper news to come out yet.

I am sorry in case if i am sounding like pro-junta. I am just tired of constant fake news from both sides and just want a reasonable assessment on the entire conflict. I do not support them."
1864,12idltl,160,3,"That‚Äôs not really true. Actually the most Aid given to a region from the Americans is to Africa which is not supplying them with oil.

‚ÄúCountries in Africa received about 32% of U.S. aid. Nations that benefit include Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. About 31% of U.S. aid is spent in the Middle East, while 25% is spent in Asia.‚Äù [source](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/us-foreign-aid-by-country)

But this is a military coup - so the US would have to put boots on the ground to stop this and there isn‚Äôt enough support for that from the public in the US. Normally the US pours money on issues, if a strong organized opposition arises they will very likely get some help."

1866,12idltl,164,5,Yeaa it's okay im not in sync with this is well
1867,12idltl,165,7,"The article says;

The junta claims ""there were rebel leaders present at the celebration"" 

Whether or not ""rebel leaders"" attended, there were hundreds of civilians / children attending the celebration. 

The region is viewed as overwhelmingly anti-junta.

Ergo. Two possibilities. 
1) The catastrophic civilian death toll was deemed acceptable to (try to) assassinate the ""rebel leaders.""
2) The catastrophic civilian death toll was the intent, and alleged ""rebel leaders"" were either a bonus or a fabrication. 

The helicopters firing randomly into the crowd after the airstrikes really points to #2."

These Burmese keep posting copy and paste comments like Save Myanmar, We need R2P, We welcome US troops into Myanmar, we want airstrike on the military bases, etc. 

Other people will see these as spams and the posters being an irritating person and a nuisance. They will also view Burmese people as weak and pathetic.

All these will make others feeling less sympathic towards your sufferings and cause. 

It is totally fine to ask for help but so it at the right channels. Posting at CNA or US Navy FB will not get the attention of the World's leaders or UN. 

Let's be honest, no foreign nations will be deploying their troops into Myanmar to fight the Burmese military. There is little to gain and more to lose by deploying troops into Myanmar. 

UN cannot deploy because of various reasons like China and Russia will veto against deployment. India and Vietnam are also against the idea.

Many protesters died in the protest in 88 or 07, no nations send their troops back then, same as now. 

The Burmese people can either live on their knees under military rule or stand up on your feet and fight and even possibly even die for your democracy and freedom.

It has to change.

She made a deal with the devil and indeed was very naive. If she had said anything that compromised the junta regarding the Rohingya she would if been back in prison long before February. So indeed many people believe she supported the genocide. Personally I don't believe this is the case despite what she said to UN reps and stuff that was reported in TV and other media outlets. She also could not support Muslims at this time because of the Buddhist Nationalism which in Myanmar is very strong even amoungst her supporters and could not be seen to support Muslims if she wanted to win the election

So now, do you relize that she was not the Prime Minister and did not support the genocide although I'll give you that she was publicly forced to defend the atrocities committed by the Tatmadaw.

It's all a bit confusing. I know that CCP have the big BRI and India also are doing something up the coast and that PLA recently supplied arms to the Arakun militia in return for protecting CCP interests in Rankine via PLA fishing boats on a Bangladesh beach and CCP are doing what ever they can to delay Indian projects in the area.

1942,mgbyxr,61,3,"Well i guess it certainly didn't discourage them, as i suspect that many NDL supporters quietly if not vocally supported the ethnic cleansing although many probably didn't realise the full extent of the crimes against humanity being committed. I also suspect the inappropriate response by the international community to the  Rohingya situation where over 24,000 were killed in retaliation for the deaths of about a dozen Tatmada also may have empowered them. Where as this time they've killed 500 and the international response has been much harsher with the USA for example cutting all ties. I think this is because of all the footage coming out of Myanmar the last 2 months is so graphic and there wasn't alot of images of the atrocities in Rankine state. With all the images being beamed around the world this time has certainly led many more people to put pressure on their governments across the globe to take stronger action."

1947,mgbyxr,71,1,"I have travelled to border areas in Myanmar 3 times illegally. Once from Thailand near 3 pagoda pass in 87 and twice from Yunnan via Xishuangbanna in 90 and Ruili in 91. I was under the impression that PLA were exchanging arms to ethnic militias in return for  heroin and methamphetamine which was then smuggled to the west mostly via Hong Kong back then

. PLA supplied chemicals to produce meth and also traded for gold, jade and rubys. They sold  drugs to gain hard currency from  US and it's allies around the world and undermine democratic societies. Much like how North Korea were doing.

Today it's obvious that CCP want to stay on good terms with militias in Shan state where they have many business interests, built airports and is a major BRI corridor. PLA supply weapons in return to protect it's interests. As they are doing with the Arakun in Rakhine to protect PLA defacto naval base being developed. Not to mention the oil pipeline that runs through both states and reduces CCP reliance on Mallaca Strait.

CCP are using divisive tactics straight out the Trotsky manual to create ethnic tensions, which they are doing right across the globe right now. Divide and conquer tactics from Sun Tzu's ""The Art Of War"" and "" Unrestricted Warfare"" written by 2 PLA generals in the 70s just after Nixon met Mao.

It seems CCP want to keep Myanmar in a perpetual state of conflict, weakening all sides involved making them vulnerable to further political and economic coercion more reliant on PLA arms. While CCP make huge profits selling weapons to all sides.

What I can't understand is that if the Tatmadaw are aware that PLA are supplying weapons to them and also their enemies why are they allowing  CCP to Build the BRI and have so many business interests in Myanmar. They even had PLA reps at the Tatmadaw military parade recently even though they  know PLA are supplying arms to  militias to fight the Junta.

I'm guessing that CCP want everyone in Myanmar to fight each other while they make $$$billions selling ammo to all sides. Once every side is destroyed or on its knees PLA will move in under the guise of UN peacekeepers and get the threat of democracy and western influence away from Chinas doorstep. It's concerning that CCP have recently passed the Military Civilian Fusion Law and given PLA the mandate to protect CCP interests overseas just in the last few months.

Even though India is a democratic nation, I imagine they will show more support for the Tatmadaw to lessen the threat from separatists in NE India and also continue with development of projects by Indian companies like Adani mines and infrastructure like ports. 

I assumed it was the Wa that were mainly responsible for arms distribution between the main ethnic factions. Who is going to supply weapons to the 100,000 NDL that are planning to take up arms in a coalition with ethnic militias? As I can't see this organisation being very popular with CCP. 

Anyway thats my take on the situation at the moment. Please correct me if Im wrong. Anymore information would be appreciated."

It would‚Äôve been much easier to do had they not gone around and stolen all of their citizens guns before this happened, but that‚Äôs done so we need a new solution. This is a glowing example of why the second amendment is a thing in the US, and why no one has or ever will have the right to take our guns.

As for government intervention in Myanmar, I doubt the US will do anything to help as Biden forgot Myanmar was a place years ago. I only hope someone has the balls to stand up and do something.

A lot of them are putting the blame on the protesters and related it to Hong Kong about ""The west is behind it to creates chaos!""

Funny how many posts on the list are fake Hong Kong accounts... Saying Chinese supports the protesters is the funny thing I heard of, just look at how the Chinese government is trying to tell their people about what happened in Myanmar."
1993,m9t3ls,28,11,"He's good friends with anyone with money. Our concerns are that they are looking at the coup like the military has won and are willing to move on to dealing with the Junta to protect their interests.

The citizens do not see the military as the legitimate goverment."
1994,m9t3ls,29,10,"I hope you realize that Aung San Suu Kyi had no control over the military, and of course she remained silent, but she probably had her reasons as you can see currently. You should read into the issue a bit more before making such a subjective and hateful statement."
1995,m9t3ls,30,3,Let me guess another sheep with Religion bias trying to push a false narrative.

1997,m9t3ls,36,2,"China does not support our leader Aung San Suu Kyi because she can not benefit from it.  Only the junta allowed China to build the Irrawaddy Myitsone project. Only the junta gives all its resources to China, not for the benefit of our people. It benefits their families.  The people are in trouble."
1998,m9t3ls,37,0,"they are atacking chinese factories because they are misleading the problem, the problem isnt china, the problem is the military coup wich has 0 ties to china. Its a way of changing direction and confuse protestors, soon the people wont concetrate in 1 target but multiple. Protestors could have burned goverment builidings, poloce buildings etc. but they decided to use their stregth on chinese factories wich contributed 0 to democracy and only hurted their economy. The goverment is using china as a scapegoat to confuse and focus protestors in other things that are irrelevant for democracy, its an old tactic, like when mc donalds says black matters so we think they arent the problem when they lobby america to counterprogress progressive reforms that could then end black inequality in america. Its strategies that sadly are efective and its working like when they burned chinese factories that had 0 things to do with the goverment."
1999,m9t3ls,38,0,"how is the lack of chinese goverment resposnse has to do with them actually interfer in myanmar?  
There is literally 0 evidences that they made the coup and the only envidence you have is that ""the chinese goverment didnt say anything so they did the coup!"" im flabbergasted how people are so desesperated to hate on china that they just point fingers on them with 0 evidence.
 They blame george soros for blaming china and making protestors burn chinese factories wich acomplished 0 and only hurted the local economy. THEY DID NOT SAY ALL OF THEM ARE PUPPETS OF THE WEST, only the ones who actually atacking chinese factories and blaming the coup on china with blind rage from western propaganda."
2000,m9t3ls,39,2,"The military can't be legitimate government because it committed too many crimes against innocents, also they imprisoned the democratically elected leaders unlawfully, by same stupid walkie-talkie made up shit. Military is the worst enemy of Myanmar citizens and its time to go. Whose military kills its own blood, only stray dogs, terrorists, cowards and disguise of disguise of the world."

2006,m9t3ls,46,1,The Burmese people do not burn Chinese factories. The military set them on fire and blamed the people. The Chinese government also immediately blamed us.
2007,m9t3ls,47,5,">They blame george soros for blaming china and making protestors burn chinese factories wich acomplished 0 and only hurted the local economy. 

lol either you cant read chinese or you make things up. The post not even about ""Blame George Soros for blaming China"" .

https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4616829319778004

This is the top post on weibo(chinese largest social media) about Myanmar.

It said ""Myanmar detains Soros-linked group, so Soro must be supporting the protest. Which is a proof the US is creating chaos in Myanmar like Hong Kong, and trying to attack china!""

China is selling the story ""The west is behind the chaos of Myanmar just like Hong Kong"" on their internet."
2008,m9t3ls,48,1,Well that's your own bias and racism against certain group of ethnicity. Hong Kong situation is not even comparable to what Myanmar is going through as much as you want to argue against it.
2009,m9t3ls,49,2,play safe bro. too much blood shed. just too much!! sad!!
2010,m9t3ls,50,0,"i was adressing the second point you did about george soros, i have heard that argument many times since thats the only proof people can give for china to do the coup wich even then its not enought to prove that it happen, only that assuming from your point of view, that they are against the protestors, it still isnt enought proofs that they didor helped the coup. The Chinese goverment itself, expressed their anger towards the burning of chinese factories, the protestors that they are adressing were the anti chinese ones. Like the ones in the photo who care more about china than the military coup wich are the real problem. When protestors in myanmar spend more time and energy attacking china, the military spends their time celebrating for they arent oposing the coup, just anotger goverment that has nothing to do it..."

That's doesn't qualify as a standard of evidence. Once the acquisition is completed, you cannot hold the manufacturer accountable for its use.

Otherwise every gun manufacturer would be liable for their death. 

I get that there may be anti-Chinese sentiments there and all.

Your the one claiming CCP/PLA are not interfering in Myanmar with no proof not me. I have plenty evidence to suggest otherwise and it makes no difference if you believe me or not cause your loyalty is to the CCP and that will never change no matter what I say to delusional brainwashed wumaos like you.
2058,mp5br6,50,1,"Yes, it's true. China only wants to do business. But that's why Myanmar people doesn't like China. China just want Myanmar's resources."

2082,mebbyz,5,-8,And what about the Rohingyas?
2083,mebbyz,8,24,What about them? Shut the fuck up with this whataboutism and go to a thread about the them if you care so much. It is very important to remember people are suffering everywhere but it is useless to just say that whenever people are trying to focus on at least part of the injustice.

2085,mebbyz,11,-10,Its not whataboutism because it highlights the people of Myanmar facilitated the military to be like this.
2086,mebbyz,12,10,I mean it IS clearly whataboutism tho. You may not agree with the meme entirely but it shows how an average random citizens life was compared to how it is now. Bringing up other human rights abuse is just distracting from the ones being perpetrated right now on average citizens

Furthermore, many people don‚Äôt actually agree with genocide and killing of innocent Rohingyan people. Prior to the coup, there was a deep division within Myanmar‚Äôs society and lack of unity caused by decades of mistrusts and hate created by previous governments and extremist people.

So what is your point about kissing Army ass?"
2122,m5mim9,44,1,"The army, like any other public body in a country is subservant to the people, do you fully comprehend what that means?

The army is there to carry out the elected politicians bidding on behalf of the people, not think that it is some political body able to govern the people to it‚Äôs will.

The army and to a certain extent police of Myanmar have totally lost this fundamental basis of democracy and they need to step back from the abyss that is a certain civil war with dire consequences for everyone in the region.

The elected politicians need to be freed, the army need to disarm and be ready for the wrath of justice as without any doubt it is arriving for the crimes committed against the people of Myanmar over the past decades let alone the past month."

You'll see the breakup of Burma, because the ethnic groups barely held together in the first place. Maybe that's what you want - Who knows. 

The Myanmar protestors are without a leader and they're running around like a headless chicken. The outside nations first need to call for dialogue without any threats. Problem is, situation went south too fast and calm must first be restored, whether it is one side or the other."
2125,m5mim9,50,1,"LOL, The military already declares war on the people by murdering, brutal torture and raiding people at night time causing tremendous terrors. This institute is uncivilized, ruthless and inhumane. Now you keep saying oh Burma will break up and turn in to war zone like Syria, etc. What you are saying is opposite of what WE want. 
PEOPLE will not give up this fight and march toward Federal system.  Even some of my friends who are women saying we are old in our 40's, can we still join the Federal Army? At least We can help by cooking  meals."
2126,m5mim9,51,2,"Thanks mate, this is some very helpful information! Still tragic to think they won't let other nations to even be able to help these poor people!"
2127,mhu4hy,0,26,"There is an another brave man casually prepared chewing betel nuts and talking on the phone while getting shot in the goddamn arm! Anybody seen that clip? He acts like nothing happened to him while paramedics are taping his arm. 
That dude got serious balls."
2128,mhu4hy,12,2,"Sorry I haven't been responding to the comments in the thread. The junta cut off wireless broadband in order to control the news of their atrocities. I had to wait until I could get fiber internet, and now I'm back."
2129,mhu4hy,13,-22,worst happened with rohynga people and nobody cared
2130,mhu4hy,14,-32,Where was he shot?  Looks pretty staged to me.
2131,mhu4hy,16,4,The regime‚Äôs terrorists who are even scared of slingshots have nothing over him.
2132,mhu4hy,18,17,"The military terrorists are using grenades and heavy artillery on civillians in Sein Pann, Mandalay. According to field reports, at least six people were injured by grenades, 3 were shot and one was killed by headshot.Currently only that he escaped the military's bombarding fire in Sein Pann, Mandalay."
2133,mhu4hy,19,17," Yes, he is. Along with the brave people protesting and fighting for our freedom.But the death toll has risen up to 550 since Coup D'√©tat on Feb1.The lives of our fallen heroes could be saved if the International Community had taken actual action on Brutal Military Terrorists."
2134,mhu4hy,27,7,"People actually did and still do care.

A real issue was that a fascist was sitting in the White House that enabled Turkey to massacre every kurdish person, women, children, men, soldiers, they wanted.

The USA under Trump and his fascist consorts withdrew military backing from the region because Trump with his daddy issues loved cuddling up to genocidal dictators.

Fuck Trump."
2135,mhu4hy,28,5,"There are people who did. Activists who cared were exiled out of the country. Politicians who dared speak up were assassinated; like U Ko Ni, he himself was a Muslim."
2136,mhu4hy,29,2,"There are many who cared. But still, I can't deny that most of us brainwashed into thinking the Rohingya are evil immigrants who fled from Bangladesh trying to take over the land. It's the result of the racist, xenophobic Tatmadaw and the previous military regime's propaganda and misinformation campaigns erasing the history and the existence of Rohingya people. It's part of the reason why we're fighting this regime now. Most of us are horrified of the monsters we were brainwashed into, and we wish for it to never happen again."
2137,mhu4hy,31,2,How do you save Facebook videos? That‚Äôs where my friends are posting a lot about attacks from military.
2138,mhu4hy,32,9,"Yes, I know. People care, their leaders don't care much."
2139,mhu4hy,37,3,"Then this is a good subreddit for that.

And r/awfuleverything for some really bad news."
2140,mhu4hy,38,1,"nothing's gonna change, no matter who the president is, US foreign policy will always remain the same."
2141,mifupx,0,10,"Why United Nations do nothing at all? Hundreds of people are dead already! I think UN peacekeepers & NATO must overthrow the junta, like they did with Saddam in 2003 and in Yugoslavia in the 90s."
2142,mifupx,1,6,This is not NSFW. People should see this.
2143,mifupx,2,7,How about a realistic photo to show their brutality..cartoons don't have the same affect of the shock of reality.These army types in Burma are not realising the risk of war crime hearings if they get caught out.
2144,mifupx,6,5,"There's never enough to show the truth.
Self righteous bots"
2145,mifupx,8,5,Becasue they can‚Äôt do anything unless every country agrees to it. Which wouldn‚Äôt happen. Only online social protest would help
2146,mifupx,12,2,"If you search #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar on twitter, you'll see many realistic photos of how cruel the military is."
2147,mifupx,13,8,"Mate, if you want to reply to someone, do click the reply button. I have no idea what you are even trying to say."
2148,mpvmbu,0,15,Reject military Coup
2149,mpvmbu,9,6,Reject military return to monke
2150,lwv8qi,0,40,I'm so sorry that my countrymen are using this as an outlet for our politics in the comments. It's truly shameful.
2151,lwv8qi,1,15,How much blood will it take for someone to do something???
2152,lwv8qi,2,5,Why does the police support the military?
2153,lwv8qi,3,10,Do none of the civilians have guns to light these pricks up?
2154,lwv8qi,4,2,Juntas are son of bitches!!!
2155,lwv8qi,6,2,"Why not make your own insurgency group? And unite with the other ethnic insurgency groups? This type of protesting will not work against people with no morals.
You need to fight fire with fire sometimes."
2156,lwv8qi,7,2,I don‚Äôt see an execution tho? Just a beating?
2157,lwv8qi,8,1,CCP is now in control
2158,lwv8qi,11,0,"Where the fuck are my fellow Americans!

SEND THE FUCKING MARINES!

The clarion call for freedom is on the wind. We can not close our ears eyes and hearts to this!

We roll in we smash their military and execute every single soldier and police officer of that country. Re-establish civilian control."
2159,lwv8qi,15,1,WTH IS HAPPENING TO MYANMMAR IVE SEEN SO MANY POSTS ABOUT THER POLICE TODAY
2160,lwv8qi,17,22,"I just realized that now going through the comments. I saw an article that Qanon believers are calling for a similar coup in the states. I really hope that stays a fantasy and doesn't have a bloodier repeat of the capitol riots, cause we are living through it."
2161,lwv8qi,18,9,"It happens on every thread. I know its not the same, but if you go on any post about Scottish independence, it's full of Americans saying, ""Yes I think Scotland should be independent!"" without having no prior knowledge whatsoever to the situation at hand.

This, however, is far more serious and the fact people are using what is happening in Myanmar to promote any sort of politics in Europe or America is disgusting."
2162,lwv8qi,19,21,"I don't think they ever concerned themselves with bloodshed, maybe if myanmar was sitting on top of some big ass oil field or something, but unfortunately I don't think we'll be hearing alot from the U.N. on this one. It's a fucked up feeling to watch history keep repeating itself and being able to do nothing about it but to just watch it happen. For what little it matters my heart goes out to all of Myanmar and HK and everywhere else that has to suffer under these bastards, may you all find peace in the end."
2163,lwv8qi,21,11,"Fear, police usually are living in government compounds controlled by the military. Any wrong move and it's a threat to their families. Even in the army, if someone wants to quit, more often than not, it's denied. The usual talking point is that you can only leave in a body bag or prison."
2164,lwv8qi,22,0,"No they don‚Äôt, and coming soon to America!"
2165,lwv8qi,23,-4,"And trigger an unfettered war? They may have guns but they don‚Äôt have jets, tanks, and artillery. The minority people groups in Myanmar have been fighting and evading the Burmese government since the end of WW2 and it‚Äôs not going too well"
2166,lwv8qi,28,3,"Actually that was my bad. I should have included the audio which makes it easier as you can hear when they shoot him. If you watch the guy in white being escorted out, he gets shot in the back later on and fell to the ground. They then dragged his limp body."
2167,lwv8qi,29,4,"That's the difference here though. We never had that to begin with, apart from the ethnic insurgency groups, majority of the population does not have arms."
2168,lwv8qi,30,3,That is not why this is happening
2169,lwv8qi,31,1,What is wrong with you
2170,lwv8qi,33,1,"American intervention will only cause more pain, rape and destruction. As it damn well near always has since the start of the Cold War.

War needs to come from the inside. Simple as that."
2171,lwv8qi,34,1,American government betrayed South Vietnam.
2172,lwv8qi,35,1,"You forgot China. Its gonna be vietnam all over again. They need to do this themselves. Do not interfere.
This is their fight for Independence, they need to do this themselves."
2173,lwv8qi,36,5,If you even bothered to look at the context of that statement you‚Äôd realize how much of a dumbass you‚Äôre being right now
2174,lwv8qi,37,0,"Except he didnt say that in the context you are trying to pigeon hole it into.  But you knew that, you are just trying to reform what he said to further your own feeble agenda."
2175,lwv8qi,38,-4,This is something the US should stay far far away from. Youve killed enough people in the middle east. Let India take this one
2176,lwv8qi,40,1,"Man, sorry to hear that. No one should have to live like that."
2177,lwv8qi,41,1,"A goddamn military coup is what happened. Now the military and police are power tripping, and terrorizing unarmed civilians who are peacefully protesting. They have been brutally beating up protesters or using live rounds to disperse crowds."
2178,lwv8qi,42,11,QAnon please stay out of Myanmar. You are doing enough damage to the US already with your conspiracy theory and weaponizing fake news and social media. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6hdCg8taI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6hdCg8taI)
2179,lwv8qi,44,2,"Oh, it will. Why? Because we have done fuck all to hold the people accountable who did it. That is going to do one thing, and one thing only. Make them feel like there are no consequences for trying. So, if at first you don't succeed, try, and try again! It's stupid. The constitution they like to hold up says to literally execute people for doing that. I'm not saying we should go that far. But, there needs to be some punishment to deter it next time. I say next time, because there's no doubt in my mind it will happen again. They stormed congress with Trump, their messiah, in the white house. Imagine what they will do now Biden is in. They're not going to hold back, and people are going to die unnecessarily because democrats are spineless twits. They literally tried to overthrow the government and you didn't do anything! I'm tired of this reach across the aisle, we need unity shit when the other side wants nothing less than death for everyone who opposes them"
2180,lwv8qi,46,1,"Oh please you Americans only cause genocide and massacre in other countries.  9/11 was the only bad thing to happen in the U.S and that pale in comparison to millions of Vietnamese, Khmer, middle-eastern that lost their lives due to the Americans (betrayal of South Vietnam)."
2181,lwv8qi,47,1,Y‚Äôall are straight retarded they outright hate big government why would they want more government
2182,lwv8qi,48,3,Yeah! It's also a very worrying trend. The military generals are regurgitation everything from the Trump playbook on voter fraud. I can even draw a direct line between the capitol riots to this coup. Hopefully this doesn't gain grounds in other parts of the world. Wouldn't want to impose this on anyone else.
2183,lwv8qi,50,3,"Sound like being in a gang, mafia, yakuza, or cartel."
2184,lwv8qi,51,4,Yeah because America is really using their guns to stand up to tyranny these days lol. America has more guns per capita than anyone and they‚Äôre a bunch of boot looking pussies it doesn‚Äôt matter whether they have them or not
2185,lwv8qi,53,3,!remind me 365d to see if America takes away guns to OWN THE LIBTARDS! /s
2186,lwv8qi,55,1,iT cAnT hApPeN hErE!!! oNLy tHe pOLiCe aNd miLiTaRy sHoULd hAvE gUnS!!!.!!!!.!!!!
2187,lwv8qi,56,1,"I'm from the future, they didn't. 
Now we got worse problems."
2188,lwv8qi,57,2,"I just looked at the list of Burmese military equipment. It‚Äôs actually insanely impressive how a country that is so poor affords such a military. 

I guess we‚Äôre figuring out how now. Slaving their people to the point of attempted revolutions every couple of decades and then doing a coup, forcing stability and reinstating the previously mentioned enslavement. 

I hope democracy and freedom win this time. 

Fuck the Burmese Dictators."
2189,lwv8qi,58,5,Yes. War. It's not like it's going to get better randomly.
2190,lwv8qi,59,2,">They may have guns but they don‚Äôt have jets, tanks, and artillery.

Assumptions:    

The military would side with the government.    

The US military is largely designed to take out infrastructure.  How's that going to go over?      

Pilot would participate in bombing their home cities, neighbors, relatives.     

Where do you suppose the military gets food, water, electronics, ammunition, ammunition?    

While I don't believe there is any chance at a US civil war, at least for several generations, if ever, the military wouldn't play nearly the role you think it would.     

Most would desert if asked to kill their friends."
2191,lwv8qi,60,2,"There's already a war, a war of extermination apparently."
2192,lwv8qi,61,2,The juntas are not the true colors of Burma and Myanmar people. They are not the sweet and peaceful people of this country!
2193,lwv8qi,62,1,"Ohhh I thought that‚Äôs what that might be but I couldn‚Äôt see if they‚Äôd shoved him down or not. You can‚Äôt see the muzzle flash, and it does look like the cops shove him over. 

Sorry your country is descending into anarchy."
2194,lwv8qi,65,2,"Pretty hard to do that when American companies are on the ground supporting the military historically and presently vs the actual unarmed people. I don't agree with the ""Military intervention is always bad"" scenario. We'd all be goosestepping if that was the prevalent attitude throughout the 1930s (It was, but the world got off its ass at some point). War has already come from the inside, it is just a one sided beatdown with no end in sight, we've already lived under this system in Burma for the past many decades. It is just clear that the majority of the people do not want this rule, our elected government do not want this rule.. and by its own foundations, the UN is supposed to intervene.. but ofc the UN and frankly the west's rhetoric of sanctions and strongly worded letters combined with their outrage is just a smokescreen for their inaction. Intervention will not happen most likely, as that would require ethical people in power. The world's inaction just shows that we are all ruled by the same cockroaches, they are just more honest about their BS here."
2195,lwv8qi,66,2,dudes gotta be a troll hahaha
2196,lwv8qi,72,2,The same racist rednecks give a fuck about Myanmar?  HAHAHAHAHA!  You need the comedy award of the year.
2197,lwv8qi,73,1,"Oh that, I totally agree. Having no consequences for their own actions is really emboldening extremist, making them think that they can get away with anything. The whole impeachment was a shit show and how lenient they are being with the people inciting sedition. This is just going to snowball into a bigger deadlier mess. Hell, they are even thinking about trying again if you are watching the news."
2198,lwv8qi,75,-2,"How does it feel to be brainwashed by the mainstream media? You sir are a clown...

Tell me again who the party is that wants to take guns away from responsible people that just want to defend themselves from tyrannical governments like the xiden administration and what‚Äôs going on in Myanmar!?!? Ohhhhhhh yeaaaaa democrats/Liberals... #facts"
2199,lwv8qi,76,0,"Yeah no, you are clueless."
2200,lwv8qi,78,4,It is. You need to oust the Junta and prevent them from taking over again. Start with limiting the military power in politics.
2201,lwv8qi,80,11,"He's saying that America is going to ban guns so civilians won't have them.

I don't agree, just clarifying what he meant."

2203,lwv8qi,82,2,Hey dummy... find me an article/proof that protesters had guns at the capital? Or was it just the police!?? Also because your dense AF... the capital protests were coordinated on Facebook and Twitter... u know the most powerful big tech companies that censor everything and are brainwashing people like you.
2204,lwv8qi,84,2,"Only the country is poor but not the military because the military controls state businesses that sell off the country's natural resources like jade, oil, gas, etc."
2205,lwv8qi,86,0,Fuck off and stop trying to tell us to start a war.
2206,lwv8qi,87,-1,They‚Äôll be slaughtered
2207,lwv8qi,88,1,It was a military coup the military is absolutely siding with the government. The police are siding with the government and are stacking bodies so what makes you think the military would be any different?
2208,lwv8qi,91,1,"Yeah. I think they might have suppressors. I haven't seen any muzzle flash in all the shooting instances here. 

Yeah, it's only going to get worse with this military. Hopefully it ends before the whole country burns."
2209,lwv8qi,92,1,Anarchy is the opposite of authoritarianism.
2210,lwv8qi,94,1,"While I do agree, the only reason America's military would go in and bomb Burma is because they want something out of it and don't care about the oppressed people of Burma."
2211,lwv8qi,95,3,"Based off the sleepy joe comment you are most likely a trump support and probably didn‚Äôt condemn him covering up the khashoggi killing,being putins little bich while he paid to have our troops killed. You‚Äôre quite unintelligent and have an incredible amount of historical and political ignorance. Also, trump didn‚Äôt do anything about the Uighur camps so it‚Äôs a very odd stance to take."
2212,lwv8qi,96,1,"What exactly can Biden do in China you dumbass. We‚Äôve known about the Uighur camps for at least 2 1/2 years now and Trump did fuck all about them in that time. Why? Because there‚Äôs nothing they can do that‚Äôll make China change that. 

Let‚Äôs say we do put heavy sanctions on China today. Well all that does is fuck up production for everyone on a global scale. Because even products made in Vietnam or India have many parts sourced from China. And now those parts become either more difficult/slow to get or become prohibitively expensive for mass production.

The shift away from China will be a slow one that will take decades and the unfortunate part of that is that China will already have a new money maker by the time it happens. China is here to stay as a world power bar some major fuck up from leadership and given Xi isn‚Äôt a fucking retard and values stability over humanity, it‚Äôs not likely to happen under him. We can only hope China loses the superiority complex and racism that Asia is known for in the mean time."
2213,lwv8qi,97,0,"Not only is that statement inaccurate but it is immensely insensitive. You‚Äôre taking the lives of people who have been wrongly executed, and the protests of those that are opposing oppression and spitting on it. You‚Äôd rather exploit the suffering and struggles of others as an opportunity to fling mud on a political party you don‚Äôt care for. These people are losing their livelihoods and the first thing that comes to your mind to is to try and manipulate that to bolster your own insecurities. Democrat or Republican you‚Äôre a damn fool."
2214,lwv8qi,100,3,Lmao drop the horseshit. If you don't already see that both parties are the exact same thing then your already beyond hope
2215,lwv8qi,103,1,"Remind me, who was it who decided to invade Iraq after 9/11? Iraq naturally being the place to go when some Saudis, Egyptians, Lebanese, and Emirati attack you..."
2216,lwv8qi,104,0,You are one country. Your internal meddlings are not my business
2217,lwv8qi,105,0,"Damn. I didn't know that Bush and the congressional repubs were really Democrats. 

Fucking over different countries is a bipartisan problem. And congress refuses to limit the executive branch's ability to start ""engagements"" in different countries. If Repubs or Dems really cared, they would've restricted it when they gained the power to do so"
2218,lwv8qi,106,0,lol imagine thinking this.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA.  Republicans literally stormed their own capitol in some feeble attempt and a hillbilly insurrection.  Not surprisingly it failed miserably like everything else they do.
2219,lwv8qi,109,2,"Come on, dude. The democrats doesn't want to take away your second amendment. That's your God given right in the constitution. They just want common sense gun regulations on background checks, that's all. You need to get out of that Foxnews bubble."
2220,lwv8qi,110,2,This would be pretty easy with military intervention by other countries since the Myanmar military has to be the worst ever.  Most of their experience is killing civilians.  Do they actually have any experience fighting other military?
2221,lwv8qi,112,0,And the average person having access to guns in the US does what good exactly?
2222,lwv8qi,114,0,Okay die on your knees then. The world will forget about you in a few weeks. At least the Syrians fought for what they believed in.
2223,lwv8qi,115,8,Already are getting slaughtered fuck these pigs üê∑
2224,lwv8qi,118,1,All I‚Äôm implying is that government jackboots are a lot less enthusiastic about fighting people that shoot back.
2225,lwv8qi,119,3,News flash: You don't need to be a Trump supporter in order to realize Biden is trash.
2226,lwv8qi,122,2,"I agree to an extent. Both parties are filled and led by war mongering, corporate shills. But, I do believe that the democratic party will be easier to infiltrate and change into a pro-worker and pro-average person party than the Republican party. It's easier to get progressive, anti-war and anti corporate money in politics candidates into the democratic party than the Republican party. But, we'll need to get those rich old fuckers out of the Democratic party leadership tho. And that will be hard because we all know that the Neolib corporate Dems will probably wage a war against progressives before they allow that to happen."
2227,lwv8qi,123,1,I don't get why they're acting like warmongering isn't a bipartisan issue.
2228,lwv8qi,125,2,"Bush was a Democrat dumbass. /s

People love to ignore the war crimes and acts of aggression committed by people/organizations that they support."
2229,lwv8qi,128,2,"They just chose to believe no president has been legit since Grant? They're rediculous, I if I had read this before the Capitol breach I would laugh. Now it just makes me really anxious. 

Thanks for the article. I think this should've been more circulated for sure just so people are aware of these peoples mindsets"
2230,lwv8qi,129,1,"Bullshit.   The democrats want a national registry - what‚Äôs the point of that if it doesn‚Äôt lead to confiscations?    The democrats want a tax stamp on firearms, that puts more of a financial burden on poor Americans taking away their ability to defend themselves.   The democrats want to make it so every firearm needs an FFL background check, making both grandpa and grandson criminals when the old hunting rifle gets passed down in the family.   The democrats want magazine limits and higher taxes on bullets.   The democrats want to ban AR15s, even though pistols cause way more deaths in America.   The democrats want to end online ammo sales - which will force prices up at the LGS.  You might not want all of those things, but the democrats in power, and more importantly, the billionaires that fund them do. 

Every fucking law the democrats try to pass is an attack on the 2A.   There is no ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù - the democrats only come back wanting more.   Beto said ‚Äúhell yes we‚Äôre coming for your AR15s‚Äù.  Biden had that shit on his website, but oh how convenient, none of that got brought up in the debates.   Your in here posting about how Americans shouldn‚Äôt draw parallels to Myanmar, but then turn around and do the exact same fucking thing.   It‚Äôs hard not to draw comparisons when the 2A was put in place for reasons like this.  

You support taking away the rights of women, poor people, and people of colors right to defend themselves from criminals - or at least support the people who want to take these rights away."
2231,lwv8qi,131,1,Pretty sure a 2 million dollar gun fine would incentivise them to give up guns
2232,lwv8qi,132,1,"Democrats want to implement gun control, which will basically give AR-15s to the rich people and not the middle and lower class people under the National Firearms Act. It's not exactly wrong to say they want to disarm Americans."
2233,lwv8qi,133,1,"Civil disobedience movement 
They‚Äôre going broke. It‚Äôs working but not fast enough. We need to shut down their cogs from turning. But people are afraid"

2236,lwv8qi,138,1,I don‚Äôt have to be an omnipotent god to know the guy ripping on joe and calling him sleepy joe while his comment history never negatively discussed trump is a trump supporter. It‚Äôs an assumption yes but I would bet my life on it.
2237,lwv8qi,139,0,Biden is trash. Trump was a dumpster fire.
2238,lwv8qi,140,1,"You‚Äôre defending a trump who went to the most oppressive regime in the world, North Korea, and called him a great guy. What weird lies do you tell yourself at night?"
2239,lwv8qi,141,0,It‚Äôs not about whether I like it or not you imbecile you‚Äôre insulting an entire country with your selfish worthless banter.

2240,lwv8qi,142,2,">""The US must speak up for human rights.....not right now though....sometime maybe....""   

Dude, did you just take 3 seperate quotes and smash them together by using elipses to make a sentence that biden never said?  Holy shit.  Ya'll must be desperate.   


The transcript from the town hall doesnt even contain parts of what you are quoting here.  
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/17/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-cnn-town-hall-with-anderson-cooper/

>that seems pretty complacent no matter where you put the quotes/how the leftist news anchor justifies it     

Youre right, that would seem complacent...IF THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SAID.   


Here is the actual quote:  

THE PRESIDENT:  We must speak up for human rights.  It‚Äôs who we are.  We can‚Äôt ‚Äî my comment to him was ‚Äî and I know him well, and he knows me well.  We‚Äôre ‚Äî a two-hour conversation.

MR. COOPER:  You talked about this to him?

THE PRESIDENT:  I talked about this, too.  And that‚Äôs not so much refugee, but I talked about ‚Äî I said ‚Äî look, you know, Chinese leaders ‚Äî if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been ‚Äî the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven‚Äôt been unified at home.  So the central ‚Äî to vastly overstate it ‚Äî the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China.  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.   


I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn‚Äôt reflect the values of the United States.  And so the idea I‚Äôm not going to speak out against what he‚Äôs doing in Hong Kong, what he‚Äôs doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful ‚Äî I said ‚Äî and by the ‚Äî he said he ‚Äî he gets it.  Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they ‚Äî their leaders ‚Äî are expected to follow.    


But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president ‚Äî that‚Äôs how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu ‚Äî not a joke ‚Äî his predecessor, President Hu ‚Äî and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the president.   


And I came back and said they‚Äôre going to end their One China ‚Äî their one child policy, because they‚Äôre so xenophobic, they won‚Äôt let anybody else in, and more people are retired than working.  How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired?  


MR. COOPER:  When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just ‚Äî is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.?  Or is there any actual repercussions for China?   


THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that.  What I‚Äôm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other ‚Äî other agencies that have an impact on their attitude."
2241,lwv8qi,144,1,"Agreed. It's Uniparty rule and acting like they are any different is playing into these rich cunts hand. 
Republicans are just as sceptical to corruption."
2242,lwv8qi,146,1,I bet your family fucking HATES being around you lol
2243,lwv8qi,147,1,"Dude, someone said the US has killed enough people in the Middle East. You come along and try making it partisan, conveniently overlooking the wars waged in the Middle East by Republican administrations.

Ramble on about puppets and Pelosi and whatever other garbage you think makes sense. To people getting bombed by the US Armed Forces, the US President's party affiliation is meaningless."
2244,lwv8qi,148,1,"Bruh. We invaded the wrong country for BS claims and we didn't even think of punishing saudi arabia in any. The international community was against us even invading because they didn't believe that we had the group da to do so. We destabilized that entire fucking region for nothing but oil and corporate interests. 

We could've responded to 9/11 in a way that didn't cause the suffering and displacement of millions of people. A terrorist attack isn't grounds to justify commiting war crimes, destabilizing governments, and creating mass suffering."
2245,lwv8qi,150,0,I dont watch CNN at all though.  So you are gonna have to come up with something else to appease your cognitive dissonance.
2246,lwv8qi,152,1,Oh god here we go. Tell us all how daddy trump is playing 4d chess to protect everyone's rights.
2247,lwv8qi,153,1,"‚ÄúGuNs, GuNs, GuNs.

I guaranteed my redneck Democrat ass has better guns and can outshoot you every single day of the week. Stop bitching like a little child. You make gun owners look bad. 

Just so you know, lots of people bought guns in anticipation of trump trying to pull exactly what‚Äôs going on in Myanmar right now. Everyone knows US police are one bad day away from pulling the same shit on minorities and liberals. 

So take your MAGA politics and fuck off back to some boot-licking sub.

‚úä‚úä‚úä Myanmar"
2248,lwv8qi,154,1,"Wow, you've obviously never read the Constitution of the United States. The 2nd Amendment calls for a ""well regulated militia,"" so properly regulating firearms is perfectly in line with the Constitution. And if you really want to be an constitutional originalist, then the national guard technically fills that role, and not everyone needs a gun. But you obviously don't care about the United States Constitution, or what's happening in Myanmar."
2249,lwv8qi,156,1,What else must happen before ordinary people are getting fined that much for gun?
2250,lwv8qi,157,1,"I highly doubt it tbh, what good is a 2 million dollar fine if the person doesn‚Äôt have a tenth of that? My grandfather had a business disagreement with an old work partner many years ago and the guy put a judgement on him for 1.5M. My grandpa never talked to the guy again, continued doing what he did everyday and still does. He‚Äôs bought plenty of houses and cars and whatnot since and does pretty well for himself, and he‚Äôs never once paid a penny of it, nor has anyone tried to make him. A fine is worthless if the person can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt pay it. Just like a law is useless if people won‚Äôt follow it. The simple fact is that when you tell someone ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt own that!‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù, it just makes them want it more. Gun control is an absolute joke, just like the war on drugs. And btw, the Myanmar government announced that they had completed confiscating just about all guns in the country not long at all before this coup started, because they knew they couldn‚Äôt victimize an armed population nearly as easy. Don‚Äôt ever give up your right to fight back or defend yourself, its a right for a reason"
2251,lwv8qi,158,3,"Unfortunately I don't think they will go broke, all it takes is making a deal with another nation, one with no morals, and they will be supplied forever.

I hope it does work though, democracy needs to be restored as peacefully as possible."
2252,lwv8qi,159,6,"I understand that they wouldn‚Äôt have the firepower to keep up, something definitely needs to be done tho they can‚Äôt get away with this"
2253,lwv8qi,160,3,So they should just kneel down before the military?  If these people had guns to defend themselves then soldiers would think twice about their actions.  All the planes and tanks of the US army couldn‚Äôt defeat the Taliban or the Viet Cong.  The idea that ‚Äúwell they have planes and tanks so guns wouldn‚Äôt help‚Äù just shows you have absolutely zero understanding of how an actual war works and the logistics of it.  The government can‚Äôt place a tank and plane and jet plane on every corner and every street and as an escort to every truck carrying vital supplies to the entire military.  An armed population is a more free population.
2254,lwv8qi,161,1,"So you subscribe to the philosophy of ""do whatever the government tells you to do because it's dangerous not to""?"
2255,lwv8qi,163,1,"No you don't. I prefer the term Crusty Joe, as he's an old crusted ass piece of shit,  but Sleepy Joe is also acceptable."
2256,lwv8qi,165,2,Then you'd be fucking dead. I call Biden all sorts of shit and I voted for him.
2257,lwv8qi,168,2,True. and both parties will work together to attack anyone who supports policies that help the working class and are anti-military industrial complex.
2258,lwv8qi,169,0,"They truly are delusional. Also, I don't get what exactly they want Biden to do. Do they want him to stage a ground war? I saw a comment saying that Dems will airstrike the place to hell. Also, how can you even justify military action without talking to the UN and pressuring them diplomatically. But, I do agree that there needs to be a strong international pressure that would curtail the use of lethal force of civilians and someone making sure that they don't just start executing political opponents."
2259,lwv8qi,174,2,"It's incomprehensible for me. I just cannot wrap my head around their ideaology. Thankfully they're a small portion if thr population but I cant help but feel bad for them. 

The pandemic really sealed the deal with these fuckers. Nothing else to do but browse entertaining conspiracy theories. Sure, it's totally fine to do research on those thing I have too. They knocked it out of the park though.

2260,lwv8qi,175,1,"You got downvoted, rethink your opinion next time."
2261,lwv8qi,176,1,You think it would make more people go around bragging about guns?
2262,lwv8qi,178,1,"Hm... a nation with no morals, without democracy, that has expressed support for the coupe, wonder which one that may be"
2263,lwv8qi,179,2,"There's a fundamental misunderstanding that the idea behind an armed citizenry is maintained for the purpose of winning a war against the military. The idea is that it prevents the government from doing whatever they want. It makes them realize that they either stop trampling on rights, or they mobilize for all-out war. At this point, the individuals in the military are left with the decision of who they will fight for, their family and communities, or the government of whom they understand their role as a low-paid tool (if the government generally strives for good, this is called service and can be quite admirable, if the government is looking to slaughter their family, this is called being a stooge). Then the government starts a logistical nightmare campaign against it's own guerilla citizens, opening themselves to a PR disaster and allowing their allies to reconsider their alliance. After a long and protracted campaign, none of the traditional spoils of war are available - the economy is a shallow husk of what it once was, the citizenry will never trust them again, nor mobilize in effort toward re-industrialization...as citizens have time to organize, the possibility of a coup arises....... and the list of projected outcomes continues to get bleaker and bleaker.

It's not that the citizens would win in a crushing victory....it's that the government CANT win a war against it's citizens, no matter how high they send the body count. The cost is just not worth it."
2264,lwv8qi,180,1,"Alright there Mr. Combative. I‚Äôve been to war and I‚Äôve been to Myanmar visiting resistance camps in the jungle and they are armed! An open war between an established, experienced military and an untrained ‚Äúguerilla‚Äù force would result in massive one sided casualties. I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes they‚Äôve been at it since the end of WW2. How do u expect the civilians to get guns by the way? You‚Äôre an armchair Warhawk who actually has no clue about how a war works if you‚Äôd been to war you probably wouldn‚Äôt be for it. I‚Äôm sure the only reason you care about all this now is that this whole ordeal is being televised. Go read up on the history of this conflict. I‚Äôm not saying they need to kneel to the army but maybe they could ramp up acts of civil disobedience, disrupting supply lines, looking to outside alliances, sanctions, general strikes and countless other ways before entering into an actual war. They‚Äôd lose and they‚Äôd lose so bad that I doubt they‚Äôd ever recover."
2265,lwv8qi,182,1,"He‚Äôs better than the rambling lunatic you had in before him, who was also old as fuck. I‚Äôd be grateful for at least getting that retard out of power, at least this guy can speak in coherent sentences."

Also, I will say that Biden isn't really clueless, he's basically a limp wristed career politician who goes around spouting bipartisan bullshit and refuses to fight for what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail. He's acts hella aggressive and dismissive at times. Him, Nancy, and other career politicians who fucked over the American people need to get voted out."

Are you really acting like Republicans have clean hands? 

Both the Shitpublicans and Demohacks are parties filled with warmongering assholes. Trump is a war criminal. Obama is a war criminal. Bush is a war criminal. Clinton is a war criminal. Biden is already breaking international law. And congress is filled with members who enable them.

It‚Äôs a lot harder to fire into crowds of people and kick down residential doors when those crowds can fire back and behind every door is a gun waiting to shoot you.  I was more so pointing to this as an example of why a population should be armed, not opining as to what the people of myanmar should do.

Uh...yeah this is a townhall not a meeting with his advisors.  He was just answering the question in this townhall.

Honestly, we wouldn't have this problem if Congress wasn't filled with a bunch of useless shits who don't want to curb/restrict executive power. They know that everyone will blame the president even though they'll continue to fund the president's war efforts and refuse to bring our troops back home. 

Military /diplomatic action should be handled by Congress and discussed with our allies and other members of the international community. Presidential power needs to be restricted and Congress members need to start being held accountable because they're all allowing this bullshit to keep going on"

The point is he was part of the very leadership we had just before Trump. He contributed to the problems we had leading to Trump, by either helping them happen or not doing anything to stop them. But even if you wanted to ignore his 8 years as VP, he has decades of supporting the garbage that makes the average person disillusioned with politics. 

> Second, nothing happened from 2008-16 that justifies trumps election

In your eyes. You're ignoring the millions of people who got fucked by congress sucking off big tech and leaving other industries to rot. [This article should help give you perspective](https://wiredgourmet.medium.com/why-trump-is-likely-to-win-again-23e56ccff95b).

Second, if you are going to argue that the US wars in the Middle East had nothing to do with party affiliation, why did **you** try to distinguish between the US and the Democrats? Yes, it was **you** that introduced talk of political parties, but now you say political parties had nothing to do with it. So, two strikes against you right out of the gait. Moving on...

>People who were tricked by the media voted FOR biden, an incoherent old man

Riiiiiiight. Because nobody was influenced by Fox News or Breitbart or One America Network. Nope. The only people tricked by the media voted Democrat. Further, Biden's stutter doesn't make him incoherent. It's kind of weird that you put any sort of weight on coherence, when Biden's opponent said [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+john+oliver+auto+predict&oq=trump+john+oliver+auto+predict&aqs=chrome..69i57.11498j0j7&client=ms-android-motorola-rev2&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:3282a1b0,vid:dBmyp75uIZQ,st:0).

>I didnt say trump was a good option (you assumed that).

No, I didn't. You stated people voted for Biden because popstars told them to. The only other option was demented, racist, and corrupt. That *should* have factored into your analysis of reasons why people voted for Biden. In fact, it goes much further towards explaining Biden's victory than your popstar hypothesis.

>I didnt mention Joe's stutter

You claimed he is incoherent. Aside from his stutter, what basis do you have for claiming he is incoherent?

>but ypure right it is hilarious

Now you're showing your maturity is as stunted as your intellect.

>And if i were to guess who has dementia between the 78 ear old and the 74 year old...id go with the older gut habing dementia (literally age related)

Age related, or age dependent? Rather than only looking at someone's age, most people would consider behavior, comprehension and speech when trying to assess someone's mental fitness. But doing that would lead to the conclusion that the guy who thought clean coal was coal that had been washed, the guy that thought people could fight COVID by drinking disinfectant, the guy that wanted to nuke a hurricane was exhibiting far more signs of cognitive impairment. You overlook all that because one guy is 4 years older. But, you don't like Trump and are just trying to be objective. Sure.

>. I mever supported trump but youve been trained to attack anything not in approval of the far left

Your feeble and misguided attacks on Biden say far more than you admit. Let's remind ourselves how this all began; you felt compelled to distinguish between Democrats and Republicans in a subject where the distinction is, as you later admitted, irrelevant."

Don't stress it bud.  You arent a doctor.  
 

>You seemed extremely stressed arguing with random people on a silly social media platform.  

It seems you are either incredibly sensitive to stress or simply do not have to deal with stressful situations very much.  There is nothing stressful about this conversation.  A conversation takes effort though, but its effort worth expending if an exchange of ideas and viewpoints is had.   
Spend less time worrying about the mental health of people you do not know or understand or ever met.  Focus on the topic.

The irony of someone who spews nonsense about Iraq and 9/11 calling anyone else dumbass is just too rich.

I didn't predict you would agree with 80 year old judges: I don't care if you agree with 80 year old judges. The reality is they are allowed to serve even when they are older than Biden currently is. You keep trying to prove Biden is incoherent by citing his age, but if age alone proves dementia, then not only must a current Supreme Court Justice be demented, but the proof of his dementia is posted on Wiki and nobody is trying to have him removed from the bench. It's almost as if society rejects your notion that being 78 means a person is incoherent."

Except you have an 80+ year old on the SUPREME COURT (where they make complex decisions FYI) and a 78 year old in the White House, elected less than 5 months ago. So, when you say it's just me, what you really mean is it is just me and >80 million.

No, believe me: The empathy is there. I just don't use it, since it's not helpful. And my understanding is there, too. I know how it feels seeing kids die. Been there, witnessed it.

This is more like it, especially the latter is true.

If you want my personal opinion: It's a shame and a tragedy what happens down there and that boy is just the last victim of the world not acting. Dozens of countries play world police today, ""bringing democracy and peace"". That's nothing but bullshit and bigotry. If that was the case, a joint task force of the UK, US and half the EU would have intervened already, with or without UN backing. But there's no gain for them there, Myanmar isn't sexy for their markets and economy. So in short: That poor boy died because the western world decided he is not worth rescuing. And that's the real problem here. That's why those people need to learn to fight themselves and believe me: The day they find the means and massacre each and every member of the military dictatorship will be a fucking good day.

But hey, I can't say that in public since it's not politically correct and condones the killing, the torture and the mutilation of humans. See now why I usually renounce from writing my personal opinion?

How about elaborating something believable and not more vague ""I'd attack the enemy of course and then I would win"" bullshit. Actual plan for the people in Myanmar, since apparently you know it can be done. ""...  plan on a coordinated attract (I assume autocorrect typo here) of the enemies support stations. The ones with weapons and ammo. To get as much weapons as possible. Then, kill them and their families with those weapons..."" So like D-Day with no weapons on the attacking side? You're saying completely unarmed civilians can just storm a heavily guarded, likely fortified military position, complete with armor, and win? With no training? You're fucking delusional.

And yes, you said you'd been through revolutions. You literally said you know your share of revolutions and know what it's like to be shot (the being shot part I can believe, and maybe you've seen combat, but do you know actual revolution?) ""I know my share of revolutions and how to achieve what you want""

If you didn't mean that you'd actually been through any or know it intimately, which is very strongly the implication with ""I know my share of revolutions"" then your statements on the entire topic are completely irrelevant all around. You can't make the claim that you know what it's like to go through what Myanmar is undergoing and then switch gears over halfway through and expect people to take you seriously. I'm legitimately curious what the ideas you're refusing to explain are.

Have you seen combat? I wouldn't doubt it. Have you seen combat from the point of view of a mass of unarmed civilians, though? I doubt that, very much so. You seem to be approaching this as though both sides have any chance in hell at fighting each other, rather than the very clearly lopsided fight it is.

After the war, the rebuilding of the cities, infrastructures and economy will start and that will cost tons of money not to mentioned the money spend during during war.

Oh, and also, 1.5 Million Korean Citizen casualties. 

But I mean, hey, that literally North Korea, right? Well its hardly an outlier. 

Take Libya, when the UN overthrew their ""Authoritarian Leader"" they left anywhere from 50 to a few thousand dead, there isnt a true consensus. 

Or Laos, which, to this day, still has people dying from UN bombs which just didn't go off, and are detonated by accident when dug into by farmers. 
http://legaciesofwar.org/about-laos/secret-war-laos/

And I don't really have to go into the amount of casualties in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, in the name of Democratization, do I? 

The Military Junta and its leaders deserve to be put down, preferably in the cruelest fashion possible, and democracy must be restored. But it would be better for everyone if the UN provided food, water, medical equipment, and electricity generators, rather then bombs and corpses."

2602,mquau6,44,3,"When in any of my comments said that the Tatmadaw is innocent?

Yes! The Burmese people are calling for help but do you see any help in the form of military intervention is coming from any foreign nations? 

UN's troops role is that of peacekeeping. Beside UN peacekeeping troops cannot be deploy because a number of member nations sees it as domestic issue and other countries like China with veto power had or will veto against any deployments.

The higher the hope/expectation, the bigger the disappointments if these hope/expectations are not fulfilled."
2603,mquau6,46,4,"This an incredibly bleak and flawed look on society. Nations that arent messed with by Imperialist powers naturally progress toward democratization, South America has been doing this for years now. And these invasions, the ones that I spoke on, did they lead to democracy? Is North Korea, or Libya a functional democratic government? No! All we did was go in, blow up a bunch of people, and then leave! If that's decisiveness, if that's democracy, then I don't want it. 

Also have no clue what you mean when you say Democracy is on the downfall. South America, Africa,  and the middle east are actively becoming more democratic as time marchs forward.

North Korea was a defensive war, it was never meant to be democratic in the first place as it was handed back to the communists. Libyan civil war started from the Arab spring, it might have been CIA funded, and assister by the UN, but there was never an invasion."
2606,mquau6,53,7,"I don't totally agreed.

Myanmar had a chance of putting the Tatmadaw in its place when the Rohingya genocide happened.

UN and other foreign nations wanted to intervene at that time.

ASSK spoke out in the ICJ saying that there was no genocide. She was eventually striped of her Nobel Prize. (if I am not wrong)

Burmese also protested in front of the US Embassy in Yangon and said that the Rohingya issue is Myanmar's domestic issue  and that no others should intervene. 

We are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic and each nation's Govt priority is with their own citizens and not the citizens of another sovereign country.

You mentioned about help, various nations had imposed sanctions which might not be totally effective. Sanctions to countries like Cuba, North Korea, Iran and even to Myanmar before had shown little or no success. Beside, the Tatmadaw issued a statement that Myanmar is used to have only a few friends in defiance of the sanctions. Other nations had came out with strong statements condemning the Tatmadaw, to release ASSK and other NLD leaders, restore democracy, refrain from using lethal means against the protesters, etc. All these had fallen on deaf ears.

Assuming you are a citizen of a foreign nation, are you willing to send your nation's sons and daughters to a country far away from home to fight, bleed and even die for someone else democracy? Are you willing to be conscripted to fight in the conflict? 

Even if a foreign nation is willing to intervene by sending troops, there will be 2 sides in their own country, those who will support the deployment and those who will be against the deployment. 

China will not want US or her Allies troops so near her border. 

Myanmar does not have enough natural resources to attract foreign intervention. 

Any deployment of foreign troops into Myanmar will spark a diplomatic row with both China and Russia which might even lead to a military confrontation and eventually WW3. 

Think of Myanmar as your neighbour, the husband and wife is having a dispute. The husband (Tatmadaw) beats up the wife(Civilians). Are you going to physically intervene straight away or advise them to settle among themselves amicably? You might want to call the Police(UN) to seek help but if the Police says that it is a domestic issue, are you still going to intervene physically? 

I can understand the Burmese frustration and desperation but this is how things are in out World. It is the survival of the fittest. Each nation's priority is survival of their own nation and not the survival of another nation."
2607,mquau6,54,1,"The US came to force out the Soviets, which is somewhat understandable, however supporting terrorists isn't. The Government was stable, it was developing. Look at Afghanistan now, 30+ years later, and women are still second class citizens."

2609,mquau6,57,1,"Women have and always will be second class citizens in Afghanistan, the Soviet influence was all but diminished by the time of the US invasion of Afghanistan, and it was initially just to deter the Taliban from giving Al Qaeda safe haven, democracy was a very small part of their many ‚Äúofficial‚Äù goals."
2610,mquau6,58,2,"When did any of comment did say what you alleged? Did I said that ASSK was not arrested by the Tatmadaw?

It is a fact that she defended them on the Rohingya genocide in ICJ a couple of years ago. 

You still don't want accept the fact that no nations will deploy troops into Myanmar for various reasons which some I have already mentioned in my earlier comment.

You seems to be one of those who post all over FB and other places to beg, demand and even flame others for telling the hard truths that no nations will be willing to send troops."

Then the CCP went and threatened their relatives so they wouldn't talk about what is happening. Again, this is no secret, people working for the UN exposed this because they were disgusted by the organisation they worked for.
I'm done explaining the shitiness of the ccp to you. Yes the UN is made up of many nations, but to think China is not the heaviest influencer at the moment is ignorant

The UN pointed at the civilian government instead of trying to cooperate with the civilian government to target the real culprits.

Also Rohingya incident is quite 'common'
Villages get raided, get boomed, get burned...
Many minorities dissapeared under everyone eyes...
People know and talked about it but because of generations of oppression people are not sure of how to bring justice and if there is any means in the first place.

Only now when hope was violently destroyed the people started to make a stand against the junta."
2685,mjvsu6,71,2,"Yeap, all those UN employees are liars of course! The CCP only wants what's best for people. How selfless they are"
2686,mjvsu6,72,2,"Uhmmm... Can I give my two cents on this whole China problem? Because it's been bugging me for a while... 

1. As far as my knowledge goes, China's reason for abstaining from UNSC's condemnation is due to how it would result to a global economic sanction for Myanmar. This, however, is not only ineffective, it is actually harming the common people more than it is the Junta. It has been shown how five decades of economic sanction only resulted in Myanmar's (then Burma) economy and politic getting isolated from the outside world, hence making it harder for any foreign sovereign nation-state to justify taking a meaningful action towards Myanmar. Simply put, Myanmar is far too isolated, no one cares. 

2. Even worse, sanctions would hurt the quality of the common people because there would be less investment, less job opportunites, less wealth for the common people to use for education, internet, and many other improvement for life quality. This translates to people not educated, not intelligent, not willing enough to fight against the junta. Both these reasons given by China are valid enough imho. 

3. Consider China's internal politics. China itself is an authoritarian government, hence they cannot ""openly"" support any democratic movement on foreign soil because such actions would only destabilize China, and China hates instability in their government. 

4. Myanmar is a direct neighbor to China and having an unstable, or even worse, a civil war state just beside you is a nightmare. China ""supports"" the junta simply because junta is the only faction that has the highest chance to stabilize the country. Hence, China's support for the junta. If the junta were to fail in the near future, then China would gladly support the next-in-line faction capable of stabilizing Myanmar. 

I'm not saying that China's action (or rather, inaction) is a good thing per se, but so far, China's actions have been extremely logical if not predictable."
2687,mjvsu6,73,1,"They‚Äôre still just allegations, no doubt that what‚Äôs happening in Êñ∞ÁñÜ are serious human‚Äôs rights violations, but if the UN really gave the names of Uyghur dissidents to the CCP, that‚Äôs wind"
2688,mjvsu6,74,2,"Agreed, it's a pretty delicate situation that unfortunayely seems like it wont get better... I guess the only way would be to fund an internal coup but then again, no guarantee that wont backfire like they did in middle easts"

2696,lwrsoo,7,5,"They grow up secluded in military compounds with heavy indoctrination and propaganda shoved down their throats.

Don't give me a reason cause you haven't got one except the innocent children that have not yet been corrupted by the communities that they depended on to teach them right from wrong and good from evil instead of infecting them with racial, ethnic and religious hatred, as you attempt to justify a genocide.

Also you don't have to fight them head on, do it at night. Attack places where they have very small number of soldiers. They set up check points, attack those and steal the guns. It get easier and you can start targeting police stations when you have enough guns.

At this point it looks like you guys are just waiting for someone else to do the work then take credit for it later. I mean it's already happening. People are talking about protesters that died as heroes and how they are buried at the grave ment for heroes. But zero post about soldiers from ethnic armed forces that died fighting the military recently. It kinda seems to me like you guys are going to stab us in the back again.

That's why we become cowards and afraid of losing the things we own ( like our jobs, big shining cities, hotpots,etc.) while we're blinding to see the dark future.

You‚Äôre right, they‚Äôll have to fight their way out of it. I fear that it is no easy or fast path out. Myanmar is somewhat like Iraq.

Every US intervention since 1945 has resulted in almost universal condemnation domestically and abroad. 

I served in Bosnia and OIF. Some muslims thanked me in Bosnia. The Marsh people in Southern Iraq thanked us. Everyone else hated us.

We risk war with China if we go into Burma and it could create a three-way war with India and destabilize Southeast Asia.

2862,mwak31,7,15,"Well the UN failed the first test,no resolution can be passed in the security council which means no country can intervene in myanmar.

Secondly, you have a military junta which is armed with tanks and fighter jets plus artillery.Removing the junta requires a army stronger or the same to defeat the junta.Even if a country wants to send troops in myanmar, it means a declaration of war. Due to myanmar being a close proximity with China, China would not sit back either .Now you have a proxy war.

Thirdly,countries are struggling with covid -19 which is a more pressing matter domestically that takes greater precedence than myanmar which is a country that they may not have much relations with.

Fourthly,more  sanctions against the junta may not necessarily work. It is only the western side that is putting forth sanctions. However, Asean with its policy of non- interference would not put any sanctions forth. Even if the Asean decided to put sanctions on myanmar,they would be just pushing the junta closer to China.

Hence, the international community can only watch and condemn."

2865,mwak31,12,7,what a fucking black mirror episode of a world we live in
2866,mwak31,14,17,"Unfortunately most people especially the Burmese don't see it that way.

I can understand that the Burmese are desperate for help from the foreign nations but they don't see the consequences and repercussions of a foreign nation sending its troops into Myanmar.

Three major reasons of not sending troops are :-

1. The conflict can escalate into a military confrontation with China or Russia which might eventually lead to WW3.
2. There is nothing much to gain but more to lose. 
3. The World is suffering from a worldwide pandemic, war will costs a ton of money. The various nations' priority are with its own citizens and not the citizens of a foreign sovereign country."
2867,mwak31,16,32,"1. Sanction foreign (including western and Chinese) multi national companies who hand cash to the junta like Chevron, Total, and ANZ.  E.g. With one stroke of a pen, the USA Secretary of treasury could bankrupt ANZ.  

2. Recognize NUG as the lawful government of Burma.  Turn over all the embassies and consulates of Burma to NUG. 

3. Set up a no fly zone in Burma.  

4. Share satellite telemetry of junta army positions with the Federal Army 

5. Blockade Burma‚Äôs ports so that all Burmese naval vessels at sea are stranded until they surrender to the Federal Army and no naval vessels leave port unless under NUG flag.  

Not a single western boot needs to touch ground in Burma.  Nor should a single western boot go there."
2868,mwak31,17,8,I think OP is just expressing what it feels like. Burmese barely have the right to do even do that right now
2869,mwak31,19,5,But man we spend so much on having a fat cock for a military that we call the army of the free world can we not just shove it down some actual baddies throats for once?
2870,mwak31,24,9,"I wish I could help. I know US has already put many sanctions against Myanmar military and companies doing business with the Myanmar military are being taken out of the stock exchange. Not realistic to put sanctions on China as China isn‚Äôt directly causing the coup and possibly a bigger reason could be that it would hurt the US economy. Any physical interruption/interaction with the Myanmar army will most likely lead to war. This makes me wonder how likely is the US willing to go to war for Myanmar. How can they justify the cost of deploying military assets and risking American lives? I‚Äôd like to hear someone else‚Äôs thoughts on this as well.
As an outsider looking at what‚Äôs going on, I really hope people could prioritize peace over democracy at this point. Is there anything that can be done to deescalate the situation with the military? If this means to stop the protests to save young lives, I‚Äôd agree with doing so. I am doing my best to spread the news as much as I can my friend."
2871,mwak31,25,11,These actions are as good as a declaration of war.
2872,mwak31,27,1,"1. Pffft yeah right. That would be extremely expensive and costly for US government, people could lose jobs! I mean, why let good honest hard working American lose their jobs just to make sure some jungle people lose their lives amirite? 

2. Pffft yeah right. Turn over embassies to the ""government"" that has no power in its own country? What next? Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state? 

3/5. Pffft yeah right. Such things require deployment of US navy'a fleets all around the Indian ocean. Imagine the headline! ""Another democrat president getting ready for foreign war"". Muh popular vote would suffer from it! 

4. And how much are you willing to pay? I heard you jungle people have a lot of gemstones? 

6. Not to mention, China. Do you really think we'd risk billion of dollars just for you jungle people? Yeah, right. 

This is satire of US' government view on Myanmar's coup."

2911,m6y58o,22,31,Head of police chief is appointed by General. And most of the higher ranking police figures are from Military. Real police man can't advance to these positions. Basically they are the same.
2912,m6y58o,23,51,Police take order from army. So it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Some police fled to India border town as they can‚Äôt carry out the order of killing their own people.
2913,m6y58o,24,18,"doesn‚Äôt really matter, now they are basically one and the same"
2914,m6y58o,25,5,"Military Junta. Those murderers responsible for a long string of genocides against the people of Myanmar. They must PAY for all this! By that, the world means NOW!"
2915,m6y58o,36,13,You‚Äôre too late to say that
2916,m6y58o,39,9,"There is no war.

Gunman killing unarmed civilian = murder.

All human around the world should help fellow human against demon."
2917,m6y58o,40,5,"These are the same scumbags that are already attacking medics, hospitals, and ambulances. They don't care if they're committing a war crime."

2920,m6y58o,57,2,"No we will fucking not. The situation in myanmar is horrible, but the United States military has no business there. We have learned our lessons in Vietnam and the middle east, it is none of our  business to go and die on the complete other side of the world just because bad things are happening.

Ready for the downvotes, but seriously. Every single time the United States intervenes in a situation like this, all that happens is tons of naive young american soldiers go and die and kill in a place they didn't even know existed before getting blasted by the world for trying to play world police.

I would be fully behind economic and diplomatic measures against Myanmar, even up to arming the people, but as history has shown military intervention, no matter how small, always leads to escalation."
2921,m6y58o,58,1,I'm sorry but that is never going to happen. Not a chance in hell.
2922,m6y58o,59,26,"ahh, sorry, see other persons reply. By showing where they‚Äôre filming from, they put themselves at risk, military will look from the ground location and try to identify which apartment the recording was done from ... very dangerous these days"
2923,m6y58o,61,13,Yeah it would help the military find the apartment and beat them.
2924,m6y58o,63,13,"Not denying, backing off is not an option.

What I'm saying is that just blocking the streets without any planning ahead, without any means to defend yourself, etc, is just signing your own death wish. Those terrorists are able and will kill each and every single one that stands in their way.

It is bravery, but it's not worth it if the people living there will all get slaughtered in a night for doing that, without being able to fight back.

At least my point of view, having to admit, made from my cozy home. Block the streets when you're ready to fight them off, when you can actually achieve something by doing that."
2925,m6y58o,65,8,"Not going to disagree with that. It's no longer about resistance. It's about fighting back now. Peaceful or not, the people are being shot at, so might as well get shot while giving them hell. I'd say some/more planning is certainly needed, but I'm going to give the people some slack because it's only recently that people started organising defense groups."

2928,mkliki,4,16,No please... This is like joking to the greatest Burmese people. Who would believe that?
2929,mkliki,7,25,Doubt this will happen. Don‚Äôt forget that Elon Musk supported a Non-Democratic coup in Bolivia to keep lithium prices low.
2930,mkliki,9,14,Too suspicious
2931,mkliki,11,48,"If Elon Musk says he'll help, that means he'll never help. He's a narcissistic billionarie. He doesn't give a shit about the people in his own country, let alone people in a country he probably can't even point to on a map."
2932,mkliki,13,39,"I mean, sorry to burst your bubble guys, but that's just bullshit, either this email is fake, or if it isn't, it's just Musk advertising himself and growing his litteral personality cult. Every time Musk promises to help, turns out everything was just lies... So sorry, but this is just a false hope"
2933,mkliki,16,10,Yeah he‚Äôs not helping unless it makes him money
2934,mkliki,23,2,"Okay, right now, I do not believe that this is true."
2935,mkliki,24,4,"If he gave a shit about people, he wouldn't be manufacturing his cars in China"
2936,mkliki,30,5,Elon has a history of doing what those in power will not. I would hold my breath on this one.
2937,mkliki,32,8,His network is literally floating above their country as we speak
2938,mkliki,35,12,And he uses child labor in the Congo.
2939,mkliki,42,6,"I don't know, he cares about PR so this might interests him, remember when he called a dude a pedophile because he said his invention wasn't necessary to save the children trapped in a cave?"

2943,mkliki,56,4,"""All rich people are assholes"", what a shitty post."
2944,mkliki,57,0,These people do not do things out of the goodness of their heart. If they do something there is always something in it for them and it‚Äôs not good PR. It‚Äôs always cheap labor and cheap resources at your expense. You‚Äôd need to trade one devil for another and have something that Musk can profit off of for him to help. Either that or you‚Äôre going to have to pay for it :/
2945,mkliki,58,1,"Even if he does have the material capability to help Myanmar, he most certainly isn‚Äôt going to do it out of the goodness of his heart. Elon Musk isn‚Äôt running a charity, either that will have to be paid for with money or it will have to be paid for some other way.

PS comparing him to PT Barnum ain‚Äôt exactly a plus"
2946,mkliki,60,9,and the $500 for the satellite dish and router? Doubt even Elon is that charitable.
2947,mkliki,62,1,He most definitely would not. Business people do not give out free stuff. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The only time you will get a ‚Äúfree‚Äù service from a business is if you are the product
2948,mkliki,64,6,Flaired it after all cause people are getting uneasy.
2949,mkliki,67,2,"Well no , the comparison to PT barnum was me agreeing from the getgo that Elon Musk is a master at manipulatijg public relations.

Another snag though I just remembered , not only would he have to launch the satellites but you need dishes for them to work. So it basically just doesn't work wother way."
2950,mkliki,68,1,"From what I‚Äôve read, the range of the satellites are limited and there are regular outages even in the primary beta testing areas. I doubt there are enough in an orbit path over Myanmar."

2964,md4h6j,12,15,"It does blow my mind thinking of the tax dollars paid out to private military contractors to terrorize and murder civilians in foreign countries, but when a legitimate reason to fight comes about, not a peep. I wish China or India would step in, here in the US it‚Äôs all lobbyist politics and dirty money. It has nothing to do with what‚Äôs right and wrong, but the American people are seeing it clearer day by day. There is a great awakening thanks to the internet and freedom of information. It‚Äôs also super dangerous as propaganda becomes far more effective using AI and social media. The Burmese out fighting for their freedom are heroes and I hope come country will step up and throw the autocrat dictator pieces of shit on their ass. Any police officers firing on their own people should be haunted by it for the rest of their life, but it‚Äôs a hierarchy of bootlicking. As long as they get paid a bit more than everyone else their just fine crushing and oppressing their fellow countrymen. Sad days on planet earth."

2967,md4h6j,15,4,"Our military only topples regimes when it's politically convenient for us, not when they're actually evil."
2968,md4h6j,16,1,Because Myanmar have no   petroleum. All you Gov care is your country's benefit. You did nothing for pure humanity and democracy.
2969,md4h6j,18,0,Yes. I suppose it's a shock to our American friends that their government is not really interested in democracy and fairness - I mean beyond a few million in USAID projects - because internally facing propaganda is in direct contradiction of this reality. To many non-Americans it is not a shock.
2970,md4h6j,19,1,"China won‚Äôt step in, the more dictators in the world the better it is for them, as it normalises it a little more which they like."
2971,md4h6j,20,26,are you serious? they're equally corrupt. many clues pointing to China helping the military. why in the world would you expect them to help?
2972,md4h6j,22,1,"How ironic. You're attacking me out of the blue for saying China is corrupt and you're here saying the US is doing nothing ""for pure humanity and democracy""."
2973,md4h6j,23,2,"I suppose Vietnam alone should‚Äôve woken people up to the fact America isn‚Äôt about democracy and freedom, only power for the few and whatever political posturing and wars it will take to keep them filthy rich. The lizard brain, where greed is unquenchable and more is never enough. Without my curiosity and college I would‚Äôve believed the high school propaganda about America, the greatest ‚Äúsuper power‚Äù bringing freedom and justice to all. It only takes a few conversations with anyone in the military who has served in the Middle East or Vietnam to know it‚Äôs all a lie. Once you get into the facts it‚Äôs gut wrenching to know the atrocities that have been committed all in the name of ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù Imperialism is alive and well and America is an Oligarchy. I hope the people of Myanmar‚Äôs resolute never dies. Soon enough America might look similar to what‚Äôs happening there, a dystopian police state, and I would pray the people here would have even half the spirit of the Burmese, though it‚Äôs highly unlikely with FB, Twitter and the selfie culture making people believe a protest is mashing the dislike button or coming out with a tiktok video. It‚Äôs impressive to see how many people are willing to put it all on the line for a more hopeful future, we could learn something from you all."
2974,md4h6j,24,1,"Too many mass killings on their own soil.
They've got immune to it."

2976,md4h6j,26,-6,What are the clues? Can you show me? China did not kill a single person in Hong Kong protest. And China never claimed that it belong to a  democracy system. So stop beaming for not getting invole into Myanmar's affair.

2979,nanind,3,2,It‚Äôs despicable to think Americans are taxed so our government officials can be bribed by companies owned by billionaires to build weapons that end up being used only when the same people that profited from producing them want war.
2980,nanind,4,2,In 2017 the US gave the Myanmar junta 1.5 billion usd. The US gives that much to Israel every single year. They are well involved just supporting the oppressor side.

2984,mn8wi9,3,30,This is terrible.  Why is this only being shared in this subreddit???
2985,mn8wi9,4,30,Literally hunting people down what the fuck
2986,mn8wi9,5,25,Cowardly pieces of shit doing what their owner tells them to do. If they would show some courage they could throw Tatmadaw on his corrupt psycho ass.

2996,mn8wi9,20,7,How are the military soldiers of Myanmar so brainwashed? Surely it has to be something more?
2997,mn8wi9,21,12,"So sad, may freedom find a way. And sorry junta jerk wads, but a true soldier is a protector of the people, not the destroyer of it's people. I served in the United States Army as infantry and the way I was trained was that every US citizen was technically my boss and my duty was to keep them safe. THAT is what true honor is. There is no honor in slaughtering your own people."
2998,mn8wi9,23,-4,Can I get a quick rundown on the Burmese protestors? What do they want? What are their politics? I come from America where most protestors just do it as a hobby to post pictures on their Insta but this shit looks to be a different level.
2999,mn8wi9,25,7,"I know, right? They are cowards, not deserving of the title of soldier."
3000,mn8wi9,26,32,"Very true! It is straight up murder. As a US Army Infantry veteran I can say that every soldier is obligated to follow all **LAWFUL** orders. If a commanding officer were to tell me to fire on my own people, then it would be my duty to relieve that officer and not carry out the order because it is not lawful. Real soldiers do not follow blind orders."
3001,mn8wi9,28,6,Most of Reddit only pretends to gives a shit about brown people if its anti-China related. Don't for a single second think they actually care about Burmese or Uighur lives.

3009,mn8wi9,43,8,These guys are definitely not soldiers. They are armed thugs.
3010,mn8wi9,44,8,"Yup I agree, this is how two totally different military's established to operate. Unfortunately Myanmar soldiers attitude are barbarically downgraded into animal level. They were taught to just follow an order from above. That's all they know and they'd never follow rules of Geneva convention.

3012,mn8wi9,46,2,"You coming to help?

Five years ago I was asked to help train and I said no.

I deeply regret that now.

I am not making the same mistake twice. I call this region home.

3016,mn8wi9,54,1,They're communist/totalitarians/authoritarians why would anyone expect any less. This is cultural revolution. Prepare for America's.
3017,mn8wi9,55,3,"More specifically, they are taught that the people of the nation are the enemy and that they are there to protect the true Burma from them. It is why the military is completely segregated from the civilian population. They have their own housing, telephone networks, internet, companies, shops, movie studios and radio stations. They do not mix with the civilian population in any way so that it is easier to order them to do things like the past two months of the coup."

What you're looking at is a child that will never own anything because of their religion.  They won't have their own house.  They won't have their own food.  They will live off the generosity of others, asking for food handouts as their religion demands of them.  

Buddhist monks are celibate for life.  He'll never know sex or intimacy because of religion.

All religions have major drawbacks, even buddhism.  Hey, if you want to live that life that's fine.  Go do it.  Don't force little kids into believing fictional, unproven things as if they were real without giving them any proof.  Don't force them into religious lives.  Let them choose, when they're an adult, if that's what they want.  

You see a cute little kid.  I see a life that's already been ruined by religion.  Like some sort of zombie child that only gets to live a part of human life.  

""Oh, but he's smiling and looks happy!"".

Sure.  He got his little cooked rice or potato cake for the day.  There's nothing else on the plate, never was.  That's not just a meal.  That's the same class meal he'll have for the rest of his life.  While he sits barefoot on a curb / stair after seeking 'enlightenment' all day playing a little drum.  Like he does every day.  Until he's dead.

No wife/kids & job + education and house. 

No apartment + dog & roommate and friends.

You've been indoctrinated into a religion.  You walk the streets looking for handouts.  Sometimes you say little prayers.  That's all you ever do."

Original comment

This post is getting attention in this sub. I just want to tell anyone who is sorting by hot that the situation this Saturday (March 27th, 2021) is pretty bad right now. Almost all major cities are being shot at and the death count was 20 this noon.

It is likely we will see more deaths. There are many videos and photos being shared on Twitter now. Much of them can be seen if you sort by news of this subreddit.

If anyone from within the country is seeing this, I urge you to be as safe as possible. It's disgraceful that the army celebrates Armed Force Day by killing many people across many different cities."

No, neither does anyone who has any comprehension of the effects that invading Iraq and Afghanistan have had. Suggest you do some reading on what led to 9/11 in the first place, or the effect that US intervention has had on countless countries over the last 70 years.

*This* is the internet. Not everyone on Reddit is American or clueless enough to believe in the world police bullshit.

What's your plan then, flying over to Myanmar and asking them politely? Are you genuinely this naive? How many dead civilians does the US and its allies have on their hands from ""saving lives"" in every corner of the globe over the last several decades?

Of course I agree minorities are treated differently than whites. America is full of racism. But you're higher than me if you think American cops are walking around and killing children, shooting into houses, starting fires, torturing, decapitating, and cutting internet and data.

Just using words and sanctions are cheaper so until chemicals weapons are used or a huge massacre is showed on western news no intervention will happen."

It is a body that facilitates diplomacy between sovereign states. The veto nations on the security council have veto power to prevent each other from meddling within their sphere of influence. It may seem useless but brcause of this veto power nations have not started WW3.
3199,mtu6fo,17,-2,"They can't and they won't as long as countries like China and Russia does not agrees to it. 

Burmese are not only bashing UN as you claimed but also ASEAN. 

About a month ago, both the Thai and Indonesian ministers initiated a meeting with a representative from the Tatmadaw and your people flamed and scolded these 2 ASEAN Ministers for talking to the representative of the Tatmadaw, saying that ASEAN don't respect your votes, etc.

At the same time, your people keep ASEAN for help and even to the extent of deployment of ASEAN troops. Look at the posts on CNA. 

Now ASEAN initiated a meeting with the Tatmadaw in Jakarta and your people again flamed and scold ASEAN for not inviting your NUG. The ones holding the power as well as not only having the guns, bullets and tanks but also doing the killings are the Tatmadaw regardless if they are the legitimate or illegitimate Govt of Myanmar. 

ASEAN do or don't do anything, also get flamed and scolded. Your people are really hard to please. 

Take a look at historic revolutions and uprisings in the past, did they have foreign intervention? 

Look at your own history. Did any foreign intervention came in 88 or 07.

Deep down you and I know the answers well but either your people are too irrational or too emotional to see the cold hard facts.

You asked others to try walking in your shoes. Have your tried walking in other people's (UN, ASEAN, etc) shoes as well?"
3200,mtu6fo,19,2,"What I am basically saying is that no foreign help in the mode of military action is coming.

They have a right to ask for help. But other nations also has the right not to send their troops into Myanmar to fight their military. 

Some Burmese begs, plead and even demand for help but when the help isn't coming, the same Burmese resort to flame and scold the other nations or organisations. 

Burmese people either have to live on their knees under military rule or stand up on their own 2 feet, fight, bleed and even die for their own cause. The choice is theirs.

No one is going to fight their war for them especially in this worldwide pandemic."

All those donations from the people went into fat wallets of the so called Democratic leaders who are nothing more than just keyboard warriors who hide in other countries and directs gullible citizens to do their dirty jobs for them.  Not once have the so-called leaders on Facebook stepped into the Frontline.

Do you know that those so-called fighters for Democracy are also adopting the policy of ""If you're not with us, you're against us""?   This is basically Fascism.

**Voter fraud bs**: there  is no proof. Normally you see voter irregularities claim in tight races. During last election  no parties  come close to NLD winning result. NLD won more than 80% of the votes more  than the last election.

**YGN Division minister bs**: they arrested  him without warrant /charges. They came up with corruption charges after  the arrest  was being made. And his wife is also being detained as a hostage without being charged to this day. So how can you trust army source on that?

**The NLD also colluded with the Central Bank to embezzle a lot of US dollars**: Again you are repeating SAC propaganda horse shit.

**I also heard about that corrupt lottery case**: so you HEARD eh? oh i trust you.

**Both have their own fair share of corruption**: WRONG. Why you go on and lie like that knowing most generals and their family members are the top 10 richest people in Myanmar. Point me one rich corrupt  NLD  member who owns multiple houses and business. Why you lie without shame?

**Not to mentioned the case where during NLD's very first rule, they appointed uneducated lackeys (who don't even have University or College Diplomas) to key government positions**: which minister? who? You must know that before that is even  worst  --  Military running the civilian affair and run the country to the ground.

Nothing I say is gonna make you NLD worshippers say otherwise.  A person's belief is very hard to shake after all.

You are always going to believe that NLD is the Pure Saint and the Army is the bad guys.  So, I'm not gonna argue with you anymore.  Just so you know, I also think the Army is full of shit.

P.S. The evidence of the election fraud, where many people who don't even have National Registration Card (NRC) and yet are allowed to vote to raise the number of votes in favor of NLD, will soon come out.

Anyways, have a nice day.  It's been fun trying to figure out how hardcoded you denial actually is.  Remember, I also think the Army is shit.  So, I would appreciate it if you don't go around lying to others that I'm spreading Army propaganda."

Lol, just point me out where I claim NLD is the pure saint. I just presenting you with the facts. Please debunk my claims if it's not true instead of being childish.

If you think army is shit then stop repeating their lies here you knuckles head. Otherwise I am pointing out (not lying) that you are spreading army propaganda.

What is it that you are blaming at? Do you think they are coward cause they protest peacefully so they can get nothing with their protest? Then what do you think about the sacrifice of over 750 and over 4,000 of 8888? Is it less than your sacrifice of ethnic armored? They are risking their lives coz they can be shot any time, any where on the street. You have your armor to protect you at least. They just throw their bare bodies on the bullets.

Do you think they can get nothing from their peaceful protest? I don't think so.  
At least they get achieved more than you. Do you think you can get change or progress in this protest without support of normal citizen? I believe you may get no progress in this battle without their support and change of mind. In every revolution, citizens will make the historical progress, not the small armored activity.  
Than what do you want? Do you want citizens' acceptance of junta? No? Maybe No. Than do you insist every protesters should join ethnic army? Do you have enough armors to arm and foods to feed them? 

Do you believe your mocking will make more citizens to join armored ethnic army?  
If you are leaders of ethnic army and your understanding of current protest is like this, I will not join you for common fight.

Second. Are you insisting you will not unite with Barmar coz they oppress and disunite you historically? Don't you want unification by historical cause? I heard some Barmar's saying sorry about history and want to unite with you. So what do you want? Disunification? I don't believe you want disunification cause you can get nothing(no progress) with this? Then What? Do you insist real unification is joining ethnic army? I don't think so. I believe unification  is their will, mind and spirit for unification of them. I think you can insist they can win by young protester's joining ethnic army but you don't deserve to blame and mock peaceful protesters. 

I believe there's many battle fields in current protest like armored struggle, street protest, ethnic unification, progress of citizen's consciousness, global interests, internal consciousness change in junta terrorists.  I believe we can win by winning in this all battle fields. And I believe you need to do your best in your position and cheer up all other participants of other battle fields who are fighting against terrorist junta together with you.

I want to say again they are not your enemy but your colleague."

Maybe you may have more knowledge about current situation and background, your attempt seems very impure to me. To me, your comment seems just pointing and blaming colleagues to disunite protesters and citizens. Although I'm not the citizen of Myanmar, I know the solidarity is one of the most important element of current protest."
3300,n0f7dj,37,2,"If I analyze your opinion extremely to the end, you are insisting the all activities of global citizen's support is for nothing coz they are not fighting face to face with terrorist junta with armors.

And two of my uncles were killed in battle in the 90s from both sides of my family and my mother's uncle has been in prison for years now. The reason I can even speak English is because my family had to flee for their safety to another country while you Bamars were enjoying yourselves and blaming us ethnics for causing disunity.

You call others racists, yet you are the only one here painting an entire race with your accusations. Yes, you can be Kachin and still be a racist. Racism is not limited to a single race. Of course people who are actually not racist would understand this simple fact.

You're getting a temp ban because all your replies are more inflammatory/incivil rather than a point of discussion (here and basically in every other post on this sub). Keep it up and you can enjoy taking your wisdom elsewhere.

These aren't isolated singular case but 16 distinct events over decades speaks to a pattern. I'm sure with further digging there will be more. THAT is called a pattern of brutality against others not muslim in this particular region.  

Edit: after doing a brief 1 minute search, here are the [massacres in Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Bangladesh), most of them religion-motivated, much against Hindus, some against Buddhists. There was one particularly ugly one called [Genocide of 1971 against Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide). There is a repeated pattern in Bangladesh of genocide."

Oh wait that probably doesn't suit your agenda doesn't it? The military Junta doesn't discriminate and has killed and raided Hindus in Burma but you seem to only worry about hindus while not giving a fuck about other ethnic minorities. India also persecutes and has killed many Indian Muslims and looted their shops and homes but you're not ready for that conversation."

3382,lxmksu,12,5,"That's actually somewhat of a misconception. The Testudo formation is used primarily for sieges and only rarely in field battles. A popular example of this is the Battle of Carrhae, where it was famously ineffective against the combination of Parthian cataphracts and horse archers. The formation was definitely not intended for pitched battle as the main weaknesses were that it was incredibly slow and soldiers within in have an extreme disadvantage fighting in hand-to-hand combat (due to how room to properly maneuver was lacking).

Instead, it's ability to greatly ward off missiles is what makes the formation so great. As you can imagine, its purpose was to defend the soldiers within in so legionaries can slowly (but with extreme safety) be delivered to enemy fortifications.

As such, this is a great formation to use if you aren't necessarily participating in melee but instead focusing on warding off missiles. 

Of course, this is not a true Testudo formation nor their ""shields"" be sufficient enough to protect against bullets. However, I do question the ""armchair general"" philosophy that was purported. If you have any suggestions on how these people can fight better, we will all be interested in hearing it."

UK banned most guns, now grapples with knife crime instead. Australia was already seeing a drop in crime before the gun buybacks. Now crime is down, but they have more guns than before. 

Even in US, most 'gun violence' are suicides. Gun violence due to gangs originates from the disastrous War on Drugs, broken prison system, racism and poverty. Shootings arise from the poor healthcare system. That's not taking into account the US being the prime destination for drugs and a ton of black market guns the government have no control over.

On the other hand, Switzerland, Finland, and the Czech Republic have many guns in circulation, but very little gun crime. Why? Because sociopolitical circumstances beyond guns that are present in the US but not in those countries.

Mate, we people lived for more than 50 years under military rule. They ruled by force, ruling over a defenceless population. It is our basic right that we can defend ourselves, be it by gun or whatever else. Gun crime will be treated as any other crime, and it's the job of the police to take care of that.

Why don't you actually come to Burma and see for yourself? Our days and nights aren't safe anymore. By day they fire upon peaceful protesters, by night they conduct night raids like the Gestapo. An oppressive junta is now locking down the internet, banning media, holding kangaroo courts, kidnapping our youth, etc.. The only people spared have been under the protection of armed rebel groups that have successfully fought back against the junta for decades, even if the junta has missiles, jets, tanks, and so forth.

You are just plain utterly wrong.

Gun deaths are high in every country that has prolific gun availability.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate

Having trained and licensed guns available is fine, but just having a right to arms is barbaric and outdated.

If some faction of the army decided to coup when the entire population is *trained* , then the population can fight back, with the help of the rest of the army.

There are 40 million ppl who oppose coup in myanmar but only 400 thousand military personnel.

If even 1% of the anti coup population were in the army with weapons and training then there would be zero chance of a coup being successful

Conscription is not about serving in battle. Its about training, learning to be responsible with those weapons.

It will be a disaster for myanmar if you just gave any uneducated and untrained person a gun, the place will turn into chaos, we dont even have enough people who can read and write, or get to school..."

Australia has about 27M people. Burma has about 54M people.

These days Burma has massacres of 35 people by lunch time.

Because the people don't have the means to defend themselves.

The US has 7 times as many people as Burma.

While I can imagine the US army shooting 7 * 35 * 7 = 500 American residents day, what I cannot imagine is armed residents of the US not shooting back. And thus I further imagine, the large chunks of the US army going AWOL. And so US army massacres would begin to drop off.

I will gladly take the small risk of a Port Arthur-like massacre over the risk of a Burma-like coup.

Agreed. Just like it would be a disaster if you gave any uneducated and untrained person an automobile.

There is a right to drive an automobile, but the government has the right to require training.

Without a right to arms, this:


> If even 1% of the anti coup population were in the army with weapons and training then there would be zero chance of a coup being successful

is a pipe dream, because the government can remove the privilege to bear arms as it sees fit."
3550,m0doec,67,2,"If the state has a monopoly on violence, the state will inevitable use it against the people. Such right is critical, otherwise, we Burmese people will always be at the risk of another authoritarian government.

Are you from Burma? Do you know any emails to contact the relevant persons in the CRPH to send an email to?"
3551,m0doec,68,1,"Do you believe less schools will lead to less school shootings? The fundamental issue of why people kill is something we Burmese people are grappling with now. 

Guns are inanimate objects, they don't shoot themselves. People do. There are other countries with access to the same guns that America do but don't have the same rate of shootings America do. I'm interested in the why, not what.

The source of the problem is what we should go after. For shootings, it would be mental health. For the junta's dogs, it's the generals themselves. Fix the problem and we could be swimming in guns, but not shootings."
3552,m0doec,69,-1,"I get what you meant. Clearly. Tell me. Are you sure everyone is united tho. Forcing someone for the sake of snowflake United is not a right way, morally wrong. Attacking to those who is not voicing. Attacking to those who doesn't side with the majority and staying middle. Pressured to choose side. Might is not always right as well as right is not always might."
3553,m0doec,71,0,"By that logic we should've not abolished napalm but war. Because nalpam doesn't kill, people do."
3554,m0doec,72,2,The only people staying in the middle or on the military‚Äôs side are the ones who are benefiting from this. Or simply just brainwashed by watching the propaganda channel
3555,m0doec,73,6,"Sadly, I think people are too comfortable with their lives to think about how their governments can turn against them. America's a prime example, with people implementing their own brand of stupidity, only turning against the government when Donald Trump becomes president.

Ultimately, at the end, I fear it will fall on our shoulders to educate the world of the need for the Right to Bear Arms. 60 years of military in Burma is too much, too long, and not something I'd ever wish upon others."
3556,m0doec,74,1,"War is terrible. Even when inevitable, the suffering it will warrant is regrettable. Yet, men, taking the aphorism 'might is right' to heart, still fight for even pettiest of reasons.

One could argue preventing war is exactly what the UN and such organizations were setup for. Preventing war by diplomacy, even if they don't always succeed."
3557,m0doec,75,1,"I can also make an argument that those nonmilitary sided lobbies, donation (dollars, euro) money-grubbing NGOs, those who purposely inciting chaos aka human vermin for their own benefits, those bribe taking senators, gov officials are also profiting in this political turmoil. There is no black & white in Politic. Politic comprises of various shades of gray."

3559,m0doec,77,0,Responding and Not actually responding. Classic
3560,m0doec,78,1,"There will always be bribing and stealing on both sides but less on the non military side. However the country develop better when non military side was in control. Right now it‚Äôs literally dictatorship and genocide. I don‚Äôt get what is there for anyone to keep supporting the military. I get some saying soldiers‚Äô lives matter too, they do but there are unnecessary civil wars in the country which can easily be solved if the military leaders aren‚Äôt so greedy"
3561,m0doec,79,1,">we should've not abolished napalm but war

And I've answered we actually now work towards preventing war. Banning napalm isn't going to magically solve war, militaries would just use other suitable weapons."
3562,mjoqbx,2,17,"Nobody will help Myanmar, mark my words... NOBODY you know why ? Because China and money.

Even if those military forces wipe out 90% of their civilian population, nothing will change.

Only thing they can do is arm themselves with whatever they can and fight."
3563,mjoqbx,6,5,"Not such a good idea in a crowd with young teenage girls ,especially night time.
They go at night, because army are now knowing the risks of negative reports.
I am sure governments are watching them very closely now. I wish them them
an early end to this terrible situation. 
Burmese are known for their kindness.
Good will prevail."

3567,mjoqbx,12,10,"Its true but also remember how syrian civil war started. As an outsider, i feel like myanmar people should try their best to migrate overseas especially youths who are educated. Junta can do fuck all when there is no one to rule."
3568,mjoqbx,13,2,"If they have guns the military will bring out the airstrikes, might want to rethink that line."
3569,m07af7,0,91,"As an American infantry veteran, I would really really love to go war with all those uniformed soldiers. Beating media, doctors, paramedics, teachers, students. Wtf is really going on? They‚Äôve been massacring Muslims for years and now this. To bad they don‚Äôt have enough oil. I think I‚Äôm gonna look up some contracting jobs. I‚Äôm finally healthy enough."

Some show off their guns and threaten people about how they are going to kill civilians at night fall since the military imposed curfew and only the soldiers are allowed to roam at night. Also, There are posts about arresting young female protesters so they can rape them. Most of their kills are Buddhists so all types of things to scare people into submission. I wonder how these soldiers would respond if people they are facing aren‚Äôt young students but trained professionals like you that can cause real harm. Out of curiosity, How does the contracting job play out? Who funds it?"
3579,m07af7,19,4,"I reckon it wouldn't take much armed force to topple this ""*military*"". A lot of the soldiers are insufficiently trained, physically unfit and have poor tactical skills."

3588,m07af7,31,17,"That‚Äôs fucking dark. They don‚Äôt see them as people, that‚Äôs the only way to justify that sort of behavior. Killing and raping. 

There‚Äôs different types of assholes. There are the regular assholes that are fucking with people doing menial work like patrolling streets, or cooking. Necessary for an army, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But generally their just feared because they have numbers and weapons. These guys either run or give themselves up. There‚Äôs rules to killing them anyway, I didn‚Äôt write them so go talk to NATO. 

Then there‚Äôs some bad mother fuckers, their 1%, that took over everything. The guys that everyone fears. Rolling around in the latest Russian tactical equipment. Because it‚Äôs quality gear for a fair price, not some Russia conspiracy. That‚Äôs what Egypt did with their stimulus. Then they must have taken over the air support. These assholes are gonna fight to the death, and those are my favorite. Where the infantry motto ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù makes sense. Where a bunch of 20 something year old kids run to the sound of the gunfire. Where we get triple stacks of assetts and there‚Äôs no rules. I was in some shit once where we had Kiowa‚Äôs, fast movers, and drones above us. Circling at different elevations. Fucking Socom budgets man. When they needed a break we had a spectre gunship come on station. 

For a contracting job you submit your resume, go interview and take some physical tests. Get paid enough to get by to train with your team for a bit and then get sent to where ever your assigned. If you want to do gate guard in Kabul Afghanistan I think you‚Äôll make 90k a year. Last I heard anyway. If you want to protect ships and shoot at pirates you might make more than that. If you escort oil company executives through Africa and the Middle East you‚Äôll make more than that. I‚Äôve no shit seen 3 armored Escalades roll through Wardak Provence Afghanistan. There‚Äôs 1 fucking road, they stuck out like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen before. For some reason the Taliban didn‚Äôt even look at them. There‚Äôs literally 2 contract groups in Kyrgyzstan, that are both there own armies. They fought ISIS a few years back, and I‚Äôm really not sure how they ended up there to begin with. The stuff exists and they all have their own sort of employment agency here in the states to get the ball rolling. 

The only people with enough money to fund this sort of activity are governments, multi-national companies, especially oil companies, cartels and similar criminal networks. You would be amazed at what get disclosed as aid money, and eventually gets routed into the accounts of these contractors. There‚Äôs really no way to keep track of what any single country is doing with their extraordinary stimulus money. We gave Israel something like $5600 a person. Seems like an extreme amount of money for a poor part of the world, that‚Äôs currently at war. I might lose you but I‚Äôll come back to this. 

There‚Äôs some stories about Russia having a monopoly on natural gas going into Europe, and some other powers wanting to get a new pipeline from the Middle East to Europe to break up the monopoly. Which will cost Russia a fortune. Syria, a couple years back, wasn‚Äôt gonna let the pipeline through. So they killed that leader, and attempted to install a new regime. The country fell apart. Side bar-Trump blurted out on National television that our troops were in Syria guarding the oil-end side bar. Because that‚Äôs how it was briefed to him. Weird that Russia also in Syria. Their mercenaries attacked an American base over there recently. Maybe 2018. We killed hundreds, dropped bombs on them. It‚Äôs was a lot. Keep following the map and you‚Äôll find Israel, and I don‚Äôt think their stimulus was a coincidence. 

When Trump was complaining about the pork in the first stimulus bill, once of the things he mentioned was billions going the Egypt, who was going to buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. Why in the fuck would congress be ok with that? Oh right, pipeline into Syria. Get on DuckDuckGo and check out the taliban peace deal for that pipeline. Then check out a map, and while your their try to find the fastest way to get oil to a cargo ship from southern Russia. Here‚Äôs a hint, it may or may not be through Afghanistan. 

Trump, as orange and belligerent as he was, did this part right. Having done anything else right, well debatable. There‚Äôs no reason for America to continue to be in that war. Thanks to fracking, the United States achieved energy independence. No longer depends on foreign oil. Thanks to the new administrations energy policies, our country is no longer energy independent. Without energy independence we will always have a vested interest in that part of the world. 

To get funded all one of these groups has to do is get a contract through something like the Paris Climate Agreement to protect something of interest. So the American govt doesn‚Äôt write these companies a check, the money does eventually get there."

3592,m07af7,35,1,"Your right. There‚Äôs different types of assholes. Soldiers from 03-09 were some of the worst types of people. The American military literally had to start a campaign to try and get soldiers to give a fuck about the people in the countries we invaded. It‚Äôs a fucked up place to be for both sides. Americans don‚Äôt want to be there, and act accordingly. Whoever‚Äôs country we decided to invade and overthrow generally don‚Äôt like us there. Congress won‚Äôt react to this, but if they had something to destabilize international markets they would be all over it. They have made trillions off Afghanistan an the only people who want us there are in the middle of the major metroplexes. Well their equivalent."

3594,m07af7,38,1,"The contractors aren‚Äôt going to get on line and start firing at the police, but they could be there. I can pretty much guarantee you that in Hong Kong every single security agency in the world had agents on the ground in constant contact with them. Americas CIA kinda specializes in toppling governments as well. They‚Äôve done it several times. They are responsible for a lot of evil in this world. Cartels and cocaine just to name two. They were probably there monitoring key buildings hoping for a break on whatever they were working on. 

If the contractors are there they are following the money. There isn‚Äôt much money in protesting. Maybe they are trying to break into a chemistry lab for new synthetic drugs, the virus center in Wuhan, the 5G contractors, Huawei, their military command center, nuclear power factories, who knows. If they want the protest to be successful they can do things like block key roads for military movement, cut off communications for the government, build defensive tools and positions, fund protestors and pay their bills. 

During the riots in Wisconsin here in the states we had actual registered, legal, tax exempt charities taking unsolicited donations and bailing out people who were burning down buildings and destroying peoples property and all sorts of bad stuff like that. Some even went so far as to kill people, and charities with tax breaks were bailing them out. Part of it was government figures, some of it was celebrities, but a lot of it was anonymous. 

I‚Äôm not sure what you take over in Myanmar or Hong Kong to make a bunch of money, but that would be a contractors motivation. The various government agencies would all have a different angle. So it‚Äôs hard to speculate.
