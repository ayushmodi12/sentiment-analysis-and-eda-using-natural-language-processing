55,m94ryl,174,8,"i think your right actually, but the soaked rags help this part. Also use gasoline instead and for added stickiness and longer burn break up Styrofoam in the gasoline or 50/50 gas + used motor oil but the Styrofoam is much more superior. it will instantly dissolve and create a thick hot burning inextinguishable gel that is akin to napalm or Greek fire. burns on water floats as well. Not to advocate going this far but you are now defending yourselfs. if you have pressure cookers there are many ways you can make them go boom with household chemicals. Fill them with rocks glass nuts and bolts; when the military lines are pushing start them in between your lines then hastily retreat and allow them to be over them if you cant get them close to place them (you can obviously use carts to push them down street). I would never normally advocate this for protest but if you are defending your life you must do any and everything to protect it at all costs. if you are dying its time to be more creative and effective then roman candles and dennis the menace sling shots. you are dying ffs."

70,m94ryl,241,1,"Yeah.... I do. looking at basically all of human history yeah I pretty much think that.
300 million people who are armed COULD on their own from milita and all agree they want to defect from the government and start a new one from scratch.
I suppose 300 million people could potentially all agree on when and how to organize and what approaches to take all at the same time...

Sure it's humanly possible for our extremely fractionated population to all come together sing kumbaya and decide equally how they want to fight back the government and all land on the same conclusion . I suppose it's seemingly possible at 300 million people brave enough and physically able to join in hand-to-hand combat... But realistically that's a f****** daydream. Grow up

First of all not everybody's going to fight because you have to make exemptions for people who have children, disabled, the uninterested, defectors, neurodivergent, the elderly, the cowardly , religious exemption ect

Second of all .
Most of population would simply move away, or roll over immediately to avoid persecution and violence. You're seriously overestimating the nature of human beings. Most people aren't gonna risk thier own life or thier family. Why do you think every society in the world is made up of a handful of leaders and violent  nasty people are continuously rising to the top and controlling millions of the rest of the population?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle

> The term ""assault rifle"" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ""assault weapon"". According to the Associated Press Stylebook, ""although the terms are often used interchangeably, some make the distinction that assault rifle is a military weapon with a selector switch for firing in either fully automatic or semi-automatic mode from a detachable, 10- to 30-round magazine.""

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon

> the term assault weapon refers primarily to semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns that are able to accept detachable magazines and possess one or more other features



Words mean things, and you clearly have no idea what the words you are using mean lol. I know that my AK, and a few other rifles I own fall into the chatagory of assault weapon, even though it isn't an assault rifle. And I know this because I'm not ignorant. You are literally the person with zero knowledge you where making fun of lol.

Defining assault rifles in a discussion about assault weapons is equivalent of you calling my F-150 a truck and me going ""Nuh uh, because a sedan has four doors and my truck only has two, so it's not a sedan and your ignorant."""
106,m94ryl,368,1,"I initially assumed you were naively talking about pure militaristic ability, ie. head-on-head battles, which the US would obviously win. No other country in the world comes close to their supply chain, the number of combat-*experienced* personnel, and tech. But I think I was a little naive too. US foreign policy had some major failures in the past and they will certainly fail from time to time again. 

It really depends on the goals, everything sits on how well the objectives are laid out. Go for an unconditional surrender of the government and total occupation, with the rest of the world staying out of the way? Easy, a week at most. Impose a friendly government and maintain control of the country under that government? That takes huge planning. Add in China, a dozen regional powers, and domestic sentiment, and it's no longer an easy win."

If things could be guaranteed to be done well,   it'd be a completely different story. The US certainly aren't at their best right now which makes it even less likely this would be an ""easy"" war.  

Edit: China wouldn't allow US troops to hang around and ""stabilize"" the area even if they managed to get there and stop/reverse to coup."
110,m94ryl,381,1,"that's what I meant by unmanned (drones) and supported by all kinds of hardware. Like an airforce, but I was keeping them separate from a land-based conflict with two armies."
111,m94ryl,382,1,"Questioning somebody on why they think something will be positive given a negative track record is not ""giving them shit"". That's what I'm asking somebody to do, defend their position in discussion. Not because I think they are wrong, because I'm interested in the reasoning behind their opinion. I understand that their opinion is their own and might be different to another American and also different from the Government consensus.

My first comment which you replied to referenced foreign policy since WWII. I believe it's been net negative. I will listen to a net positive arguement.

My second comment incorrectly mentioned the US not beating a nation's army since WWII. I assumed they either withdrew or were fighting something other than a national army. I also failed to mention the necessity for allies in larger wars. That was my mistake which somebody else pointed out to me. I never implied that the other person's position was to invade, rather saying that shouldn't be an option; one that I don't believe, and would like to confirm, isn't held by the other person.

Does that help clarify a few things?"
112,m94ryl,387,1,Show the right tit ASAP
113,m94ryl,390,1,"you can’t keep them separate though because the us military uses them in tandem, every squad of infantry on the ground has a air controller with them to direct air strikes on anything that points a gun at them. i understand your meaning, and your reasoning on your conclusion, but the two have to be considered together. China has all of about a dozen modern stealth fighters for air superiority, and they are very prone to mechanical issues. the United States has hundreds to thousands of modern stealth fighters, more than enough for complete air superiority over both a tactical and strategic air zone. with that air superiority they have free rain to rain hell on the chinese ground forces as our own ground forces advance on their position. Iraq had one of the best armies in the world and we absolutely destroyed them in two weeks."
114,m94ryl,391,1,"I think the UN should be the ones to handle it. Peace-keeping force to ensure the human rights of the people there. China vetoes any such action. But yeah If you think any other kind of sanctions or anything are going to have an impact on a regime like that, guess again. Also geopolitical references should be kept to the last 30 years for strategic relevance. The game has changed a lot since the true dawn of the internet age. I'm gonna put a pin in this because it deserves it's own thread. But I think you have a...warped view on the concept of national sovereignty. It is my opinion that sovereignty is forfeit when the human rights of your people are widely infringed upon and especially when a genocide is undertaken.  
inb4 native americans: the idea of national sovereignty was not firmly outlined until after WWII so trying to apply any kind of international legal statuses to any actions before then are genuinely not relevant."

118,m94ryl,402,1,Logistics win wars. Where is this “long term war” being waged? No way China could project their forces across the pacific in massive numbers and also sustain an advantage In the long term. The US already had local bases in Asia and the pacific to maintain the early slog and make them pay with a huge technology/ air and naval power advantage. Invading China would also be impossible. But knowing the actual ground warfare limitations it’s incredibly weighted toward the US advantage.
119,m94ryl,406,1,"long term war would be namely in southeast asia and the south china sea, you’ve brought all points that i agree with actually, however whilst we can’t invade China we also can’t nuke them either. Myanmar, North Korea, Taiwan, and India are the most likely battlefields we are looking at for our future conflicts. I personally don’t know how it would go for China, would the North Koreans fight with them and invade South Korea? the war with China will almost certainly start over Taiwan imho, which potentially means Japan and South Korea getting involved as well. Chinese expansionism is currently running unchecked and our key allies in the Asian-Pacific are in their sights. we need a strong president right now who realizes that China is our enemy, who takes a hardline against China for the sake of our allies and our nation. Is Biden that president? absolutely not. was Trump? kinda. for the sake of our future and the future of every one of our asian allies, we need to turn our eyes against china. lest taiwan become another hong kong."
120,m94ryl,409,1,"Because that's the real world response. You can wish for the UN to swoop in if it were a perfect world but we're not in a perfect world. If we're imagining perfect worlds and ignoring the contexts and interplay of several nations and a couple of superpowers, then we can imagine a world where the coup didn't even happen."
121,m94ryl,410,1,"Yeah my UN scenario was 100% an ideal scenario. Obviously I'm not delusional and believe that to actually be happening or forthcoming. This is precisely why the US is forced to take unilateral action like we are in Tigray right now training forces. It's not ideal, but it's better for the people of Myanmar, several of whom I've spoken with personally using online translators ,and they are okay with US military intervention. So I think ""nobody gives a shit about human rights"" is an extremely cynical worldview and a dangerous point to cede. We should try to live up to our agreements. In another thread I said that I like the idea of a US world police *IF* we do it to enforce UN agreements and human rights standards, but that historically has not been our reason for intervening."

That means when you know who is in charge and  responsible for this kinda chaos, twisting the roles of military and police into this distorted version of itself. You, even some random dude in a far off country can effect the ""leadership"" of someone who hordes power...because you know...**""All roads lead to Rome"".**

Use your **creativity and imagination**. Me personally would rather the ""leadership"" who sign off on this crazy would go for Therapy.

I dont know man, I dont know who figure running around headshotting people inspires confidence in their leaderships skills.

Lets think out of the box.

For example, you can document all areas where ""head shots"" and murders took place againts the citizens. Than take note of the nearest police and military stations where this was committed. 

With that knowledge you already have alot to work with. 
Heck simply passing that knowledge around would create a butterfly effect. I am sure there is alot of bored Reddit users around.

Anyway. You dont have to go out for blood, **think Like Batman**,  think of this situation like an **Onion**. Those who are trying to preserve their position do it likely for personal security and safety, in a deeper level its fear. **They are using the police and military** as a cover. You gotta go deeper. Remember the people in the military and police are Human Beings as well. That means they are a mixed bag. Those who are trying to preserve their status will try to get the military and police to be on their side, as if its a **shared fate**...when really they really should go for Therapy and counseling.

Self Defence people. When you face someone so blatantly disregarding their own humanity and yours, Self Defence reallllly helps....

358,lvvvm8,332,1,"Developed countries are synonymous with high income countries. You know exactly what I'm comparing America to. Countries in a similar range of development. South Africa is considered to be *developing.* It has aspects that are very developed, but large aspects which are not considered developed. You're listing a whole bunch of countries which are considered to be *developing*, not developed. The developed countries are high income. The *Western World* is generally considered to be North America, Europe and Australasia. Anyway, none of this matters, because no matter if we consider a comparison to the Western World, ""developed countries"" or ""high income countries,"" the result is the same. The US has the highest murder rate. By far. 

>Moreover, in regards to gun violence, nearly all of the violence takes place in a few select cities — several of them having stringent gun laws. An oddity for sure if your underlying unstated hypothesis is correct.

No, it's certainly not true that ""nearly all"" of the violence takes place in a few select cities. In fact, *half* the violence happens in 127 cities, including the larger ones. The fact that they have stringent gun laws is irrelevant - the fact is that *all* of these illegal guns started life as legal guns, and were only manufactured because there is a huge market for them in a country awash in gun culture. All of the guns found in cities like NYC and Chicago were either bought in states with lax gun laws or they were stolen from irresponsible legal gun owners who didn't secure them adequately. They were then transported across state lines and sold in predominantly low income inner city areas, where they drive the murder rate. Besides which, Dallas has widespread legal gun ownership and its per capita murder rate is consistently four times that of NYC according to FBI figures. 

>And finally, there is quite a bit of data that indicates reducing gun laws and allowing concealed carry laws to be put in effect actually decreases murder and crime rates.

Again, tell that to Dallas with 4x the per capita murder rate of NYC despite widespread legal gun ownership. Denying the extent to which gun culture in the US drives its uncommonly high murder rate just sounds like insanity to sane, rational people."

388,lwof70,49,1,"Our ""government"" before this was a quasi-democracy. Although we were on paper ""democratic"", our constitution (written by the military that oppressed us and killed ethnic minorities for decades) always allowed 25% (regardless of votes) of the seats in parliament to the military. Thus, we had a civillian branch (75%) and military branch (25%).

Additionally, the military had it's own political party called USDP which people (extremists right wing supports like Wirathu, basically the Hitler for Rohingyas) could vote for. So this means that the Military (military branch and USDP) had a lot of control when it came to our decisions. They control immigrants and defenses and more, as they were the ones who massacred the Rohingyas. We're fighting now for democracy, meaning to eliminate the 25% (and more) share that the military dogs hold in our country. 

Our government now is the CRPH who are the rightful democratically elected leaders in hiding. They are basically working to represent Myanmar in the UN and so on. The military are the ones who assumed the position of government by force. Their dogs (police and soldiers alike) are the ones who killed the Rohingyas and and the ones who are killing us now."
389,lwof70,55,1,"This is a reply I got from another comment I made:

I'm a Burmese currently living in Yangon.

1. Yes. I very much want the USA to get involved. It doesn't even have to be armed forces. Drone or missile strikes would be enough. And this is what nearly everyone in my country wants right now. A lot of people are so desperate for US help to the point they want to give away some land to the US or they would happily become a US colony.
2. I personally don't feel that way. But everyday, we feel helpless for all the dead people that we couldn't save. How can we, an unarmed population, win a fight against an armed and trained military? For most of us, foreign intervention is our biggest dream now.

Most people here see the US as world police, in a good way, and that's what I see too. If the US never took part in the Korean war, there wouldn't be South Korea of today. What I always tell to those who don't like the idea of the US being world police is this - imagine China or Russia being world police. The only reason the entire world (except america of course) hasn't been annexed by China and Russia is because they fear the US. Otherwise, the organ harvesting done by CCP would be done everywhere.

Realistic views is this, no country is keen to send military into Myanmar firstly due to the reason that by doing so, any other country would be empowered to do so in their area of influence like China and Russia. China could use this example and invade its neighbours as it pleases for this one example. 

Myanmar does not have oil and thus America other than voicing concerns, putting tariffs and calling support only verbal talks in the end will still recognise the Junta. No other nation can provide help if even America is not going to do anything beyond symbolic.

무슨일이 일어 났고, 왜 일어 났는가?

2021년 2월 1일, 민 아웅 훌라잉 사령관이 이끄는 미얀마 군이 쿠데타를 일으켰고, 민주적으로 선출된 정부를 전복하였습니다. 1962년부터 2011년까지 수십년동안 잔혹한 군부독재 치하에 있던 국가로써, 그들이 과거에 인종청소와 전쟁범죄 등 수많은 야만적인 범죄를 저질러 왔음은 분명한 사실입니다. 악명높은 쿠데타 괴수인 민 아웅 훌라잉은 소수민족에 대한 조직적인 차별과 인권유린에서부터 로힝야인 인종청소까지 수많은 범죄행위로 잘 알려져 있으며, 그로 인해 국제적인 비난과 제재를 받고 있습니다.
쿠테타와 시민들이 민주적으로 선출한 몇몇 공직자에 대한 구금이 발생한 후, 미얀마 시민들은 전국가적이고 비폭력 저항운동을 시작하고, 시민 불복종 운동(CDM)에 참여하였습니다. 그러나, 무장군인들은 비폭력 저항운동가들과 불복종 운동 참여자들에게 실탄과 방화, 불법연행과 결국 죽음으로 몰아가는 상상할 수 없는 고문으로 무자비하게 대했습니다. 다시 언급하기 싫지만, 비인간적인 무장 군인들에 의해 저질러진 혐오스러운 예를 몇가지 들자면:
- 집에 숨어들은 비폭력 운동가들을 도운 임산부의 머리에 대고 총을 쏘았음.
- 거리에서 부상자를 구하려는 의학도생을 죽임.
- 활동가를 납치하고, 산이나 뜨거운 물을 입속에 붓는 고문으로 죽음에 이르게 함.
- 총으로 쏘아 죽인 19세 운동가의 무덤을 경찰들이 비밀리에 파헤침.

이 글을 쓰는 지금까지 200명 이상이 살해 당했으며, 수천의 시민들이 불법적으로 감금되었습니다. 자유를 향한 싸움에 떨어진 꽃잎들은 정치인들, 의사들, 승려들, 임산부와 어린이들만이 아닙니다.
군인들의 잔혹성은 매일매일 계속 증가하고 있고, 이 극악한 범죄들은 멈추어져야 합니다.  이런 환경에도 불구하고, 미얀마의 국민들은 그들의 권리와 자유를 위한 싸움을 계속할 것입니다.

이 혁명에 참여하고 도움을 주시려면:

- 시민들과 공무원들이 그들의 직업과 수입을 희생해 가면서 이 싸움에 참여하고 있습니다. 거기에, 많은 방화, 파괴와 다른 폭력행위로 인해, 많은 사람들이 집을 잃거나, 혹은 안전한 장소로 옮기느라 집을 포기해야 했습니다. 기본적인 경제적 결핍에 대해 미얀마 국민들을 직접적으로 지원할 수 있는Mutual Aid Myanmar를 방문해 주세요. 또한 군부독재와 싸우는 임시 정부인 CRPH의 기금에 기부함으로써 지원을 해 주실 수도 있습니다.
- 지금의 이 싸움을 도와주시고 싶은 분들은, 사시는 곳에서 비폭력 운동을 조직해 주십시요.조직을 만들기 전에 당국에 먼저 확인해 주십시요.
- 당신을 대표하는 기관이나 국회의원들에게 편지, 이메일 혹은 전화를 통해, 현 미얀마의 상태에 대해 병력지원, 표적 제재 혹은 다른 종류의 가능한 지원 방법들과 같은 도움을 보내는 것에 대해 지지하는 입장을 밝혀 주시는 것도 도움이 됩니다.
- 미얀마의 현 상황에 대해 인지도를 높이는 것으로 도움을 주실 수도 있습니다. 친구들, 가족과 이웃들에게 뉴스들을 퍼뜨려 주십시요. SNS에 공유해 주시고, 그때 아래의 해시태그를 포함하도록 해 주십시요.:

감사합니다!

단지 이 게시글을 읽고, 미얀마의 상황에 관심을 기울여 주신 것만으로도 당신은 이미 미얀마 국민들에게 도움을 준 것입니다. 이미 당신은 미얀마의 모든 시민들을 돕고, 자유와 정의를 위해 싸우는 혁명의 참여자임을 기억해 주십시요. 이 싸움은 종교와 인종에 상관없이 모든 이에게 평등한 권리와 기회를 주는 밝은 미래를 위한 싸움입니다.

414,m85p3l,8,7,"Hello everyone, I had an idea of something we (as in people outside Myanmar) can do to show support. Not sure if it's a good idea or if it's even feasible, but I just wanted to comment on it and see what other people think. 

Basically, what if all of us, people from all around the world, record a really short video showing support for the people of Myanmar (like just a few seconds) and then we get someone to edit all the short clips together, and then find a way to send it online to people in Myanmar. I kind of think this would all be feasible given the power of these online networks. 

I know it's not like this would change anything concretely, but I think the people in Myanmar probably feel so alone in this fight against the military, and maybe something like this would give them a boost in morale, knowing that people all over the world are watching an supporting them. It would show them that what they are doing has a positive impact far beyond Myanmar and that people are listing to them.

458,m85p3l,125,2,"The US and it's allies are stuck between a rock and a hard place. CCP know this and have set the trap. There are over 100,000 people in Myanmar fighting for ethnic militias and another 100,000 NDL preparing to take up arms against the 400,000 Tatmadaw back by the CCP.

If US puts boots on the ground it could easily become the next Vietnam also diverting military strength from other theatres such as South China Sea and the other 16 countries CCP have territorial disputes with. If they support militias with military supplies or airstrikes CCP would increase support for Tatmadaw resulting in the proxy war. 

If US do nothing to arm the militias then the atrocities will continue in a war of attrition against  them supported by CCP. Resulting in CCP gaining more control and securing access to the Indian Ocean via BRI from Yunnan, opening up a new front in Arunchal Pradesh and supplying seperatists in eastern India and even more influence in Bangladesh without PLA firing a single shot.

This would result in India being surrounded by CCP controled territories and give PLA a port that is already under construction in Rankine State.

Morality and also strategic concerns suggest that the West has to urgently supply military equipment and humanitarian supplies to coalition of militias fighting the Tatmada and possibly support them with airstrikes in an effort to maintain any hope of democracy and stop CCP gain even more influence in Myanmar. 

CCP are carrying many covert operations in Myanmar at every level with every means imaginable. CCP support the genocide of 30,000 Rohingya and will do anything to maintain Myanmar BRI to Rankine from Yunnan. 

Also they want control of the Christian state of Kachin which is rich in resources such as gold, copper, ruby's, jade and arable land, with strategic value bordering India.

 CCP also want more influence in Shan state to secure the BRI project linking China to ports in the Indian Ocean where roads, oil pipelines, airfields, etc have already been built or are under construction. Controlling these areas would also threaten the Wa ethnic group who are responsible for supplying many weapons to other groups fighting the Tatmadaw.

CCP are waiting to see what The Quad, 5 Eyes and EU's next move will be. Will they turn out to be paper tigers and still continue to finance CCP by being reliant on Chinese imports and supplying them with resources such as iron ore etc or will they finally relise that this is WW3 and they have been under unrestricted, non conventional, non kinetic attack from the CCP/ PLA since Nixon met Mao and Carter met Deng Xiaoping back in the 70s."

466,m85p3l,139,1,"I highly doubt that. That is a simple thought. Policies are far beyond that. 

China have a warm relations with the NLD government of Myanmar. Through that relationship, billions of investment are invested and bilateral trade signed. 

It serves China no good to support the Junta simply because in the 90s The other Junta till today the current general, all have doubts and guesses of china’s choices and policies. Basically they do not trust each other. China would much prefer NLD government than Junta because NLD is a democratic government which courts investments, flow of funds, trades and mutual benefits of which China benefits from capitalism system of the status quo of the world and in no way would benefit having a negative press, negative sentiments amount the Burmese, negative investments and stop of economic activity. In true view I think China is hurt most for loss of investments. 

China may be communistic in nature and nationalist + authoritarian all in one, they are definitely not dumb enough to forsake economic activity and the Junta clearly lacks that compared to NLD government or for the matter a democratically elected or a popular government. So in deeper sense, China and Russia basically opposed for the sake of opposing against the USA and the USA position just so happened to benefit Myanmar rhetoric wise and sanctions but by no means USA cared and China don’t care. 

Myanmar to these 2 or 3 countries mean nothing due to no resources, infrastructure, development status and stability are all very fragile and feeble. It basically is a watered down Syria to Russia and USA is of Myanmar to China + Russia and USA. A game of chess to see what the other party would do basically a testing ground for these “superpower” nations to formulate policies. 

They obviously do not care as much since it is not their citizens. Really Myanmar is just a testing ground and a game of chess to USA and CHINA if you were to ask me. More issues are used against China now like cotton in xinjiang using forced labor, individual free journalists went in and filmed a series showing 24000 muslims temples which was highly opposite of “oppression” of xinjiang touted by USA. And with that CHINA just launched a campaign of their own with cgtn saying USA a hypocrite killing millions, inciting genocides, displacing and destroying the indigenous red indians true heirs to American lands. 

They are now essentially attacking each other and slinging mud at each other and Myanmar to them is the latest battle ground for chess not for influence but simply to test the other side’s lower limit to what they can accept before retaliation. 

It’s been close to 2 months and still no action from UN, G7, Washington, Beijing, Moscow, Tokyo, Seoul. Basically the G7, UN, EU, USA and + 3 nations other than verbal warnings and symbolic sanctions nothing would come out of it. 

Only time can help Myanmar sadly. I wish you the best if your Burmese and I pray for you to be safe from tyranny. Stay safe, good luck. Civil disobedience movement (CDM) we foreigners saw it and our thoughts are with you guys other than that we can do nothing just like all our government nothing."

**No. A chicken sandwich is not an opinion. That it tastes good** ***is*****.**

Questions like this are easily answered by knowing the meanings of words—or just knowing the different parts of speech. That alone would tell you not everything is the same aspect of reality.

An opinion is an aspect of the mind or thought. It’s not a tangible object.

The question is inviting the Reader/Writer to commit a fallacy I years ago dubbed [“The Great and Powerful IS.”](https://www.quora.com/q/gfbkoswbtztkmfcp/The-Great-and-Powerful-IS) This is the practice of using a linking verb (is, are, were, was, etc.) to magically transform one aspect of reality into another aspect of reality—where the two aren’t even the same kind of reality.

In this case, an opinion (a mental perspective) is potentially equated with actions, physical objects, attributes, qualities, and all other dissimilar aspects of reality (all of which are compassed in the term *everything*) by the decree of the word “is.” But there’s simply no legitimate and rational way to morph “everything” into a opinion.

***The World needs to go back school and learn the basics of grammar, composition, and definition. Starting with millions of teachers. And ban Philosophy. Seriously.***

*Or, just learn how to put things into the context we have in mind. It’s possible the question means to ask: “Is every assertion an opinion?” or something to that effect. I wish more Quorans would learn to avoid ambiguity.*

Again, I don't deny the support we received. It was crucial for us. But at the same time, if we were genociding the entire population of a minority, and we got no support becuz of that, I would still say we deserved it.

Heck, the reason why we received literally no support among South East Asian nations is becuz out of all the ideologies, we picked communism. And that contributed to a rise of radical communist activists and insurgencies in the region, even Burma was affected. That's why I don't complain that we received no support from the region. So yes, we deserved it."

It cannot be overemphasized how much that act will complicate any efforts to attract western interest in intervention.

I appreciate that she might have been pressured into doing that by the military, but it was a grave miscalculation on her part if that is the case.  She's been violently forced out of power anyway, but now she's also on record as a genocide apologist in western eyes.  It's very, very difficult to muster up public support for foreign interventions that benefit genocide apologists."

The military want *their* faction in power. That’s all. It almost happened here in the states. To those with power, equality very frequently appears to them as oppression and they’ll tear down any system that threatens to lift others out of the gutter even if it doesn’t threaten the quality of life of those in power. The Myanmar opposition was not in power and the military supported the opposition. So they lied about election fraud and demanded recounts, do-overs, and finally they demanded the keys to government at the tip of the spear.


Exactly what happened in the US except our minority party is full of losers from the fries and a milkshake militia drunk off that Qock (the Q conspiracy bullshit). Our minority party found out super quick that military and law enforcement as whole institutions were, in fact, not supportive of their bullshit whatsoever. This is not so in Myanmar. Also, our minority party (I love saying that) recently lost control of both the executive and the legislative branches of government due to the last 4 years laying bare their abject hatred of their fellow Americans, which is also a direct comparison to what’s happening in Myanmar and also addresses your question about how could they do this to their fellow countrymen. 


It’s easy to answer your question if you’re an American. Just look at the modern Republican Party. If you’re not an American, pick up any book about the Third Reich."

And I think the fact that we are a small country with ~10 Million population has a lot to do with the stability of the country.

He was credited with finding loopholes in the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar and in particular with creating the office of state counsellor, which enabled Aung San Suu Kyi to become the de facto head of government in 2016.[6] He advocated constitutional change in Myanmar,[7] believing that the 2008 Constitution, which was drafted by the military, should be replaced and not merely amended.

>explicitly ties the NLD to the violence

Not quite the claim I made."
582,lap93j,149,0,"Not talking about military action at all here, but about the government's own actions. And yes, I know the government is not entirely civilian nor NLD, but it has its own responsibilities and should be held accountable too. That's why you end up with the following in the section on responsibility:

> 93. The constitutional powers of the civilian authorities afford little scope for controlling the actions of the Tatmadaw, nor is there any indication that they participated directly in planning or implementing security operations or were part of the command structure. Nevertheless, nothing indicates that the civilian authorities used their limited powers to influence the situation in Rakhine State where crimes were being perpetrated. The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population. On the contrary, the civilian authorities have spread false narratives, denied the wrongdoing of the Tatmadaw, blocked independent investigations (including that of the fact-finding mission), and overseen the destruction of evidence. Through their acts and omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes. 

The crux of the issue regarding the NLD and civilian part of the gov. is the forced permanent relocation of Rohingya through infrastructure projects implemented *after* the Tatmadaw cleared the area. Paragraph 50 says exactly that, and I recall that the extended version of the report goes into a lot more detail. Companies linked to the NLD are also mentioned IIRC.

It may not seem like it, but this is very strong language for a UN-affiliated report."

If a government is doing its job well, it deserves to stay (there are many ugly things with CPC but the benefits ultimately outweigh the flaws). If a government is horrendous and there is a clear better alternative, it has no mandate to stay. Simple as that. (For Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi is infinitely better than the dictatorship)."

601,mj2mcn,62,1,Hello bot
602,mj2mcn,65,2,"I definitely understand what you're saying. The very unfortunate fact of the matter is that the conduct that is occurring, does not appear to fit within the scope of any legal justification that would obligate China to agree with the remainder of the UN. I just read through ""Universal Jurisdiction,"" which is only relevant and applicable to hold individuals accountable to stand trial as accused (not military intervention), and from what I can tell, in order for Universal Jurisdiction to apply, it would need to be filed by a State — a country willing to do so, which the US has never done — and must also be investigated within the State in which the alleged offenses took place. That means the junta would have to be willing to open an investigation into its own conduct, which it has the local jurisdictional the right to refuse. 

Police action, or enforcement action, most commonly known by modern standards as counter-insurgency, is only applicable when an ""insurgency"" can be established. 

""When insurgency is used to describe a movement's unlawfulness by virtue of not being authorized by or in accordance with the law of the land, its use is neutral. However, when it is used by a state or another authority under threat, ‘insurgency‘ often also carries an implication that the rebels' cause is illegitimate, whereas those rising up will see the authority of the state as being illegitimate."" (F. Weigand, 2017, afghan's taliban — legitimate jihadists or coercive extremists? From the Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding) which makes it sound like it not apply due to the junta's claim of election fraud and its declaration to hold new elections in one year.

In the case of China blocking action by the UN, they're doing so based on: 1) the claim that it is an ""internal matter"" and a ""cabinet reshuffle"" and 2) speculative, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ""And the largest foreign player in Myanmar's economy, China, will be all too happy to recalibrate its engagement to recognize the new facts on the ground""

It's probably safe to assume that the Chinese government is resistant to an even greater presence of the US in Asia. Historically, any time the US military sets foot in a country, they begin to establish a military bases in that country. There are currently over 800 military bases in foreign countries all across the world, with hundreds of thousands of troops deployed throughout.

The way I interpret all of this tells me that, until China comes on board with the rest of the UN, there are no legal grounds for military intervention without a declaration of war or a straight up invasion, which would likely set the stage for, at minimum, a conflict between whichever invading country is present, Myanmar's junta, and China, since it would be their UN opposition that was ignored. In that event, it would likely set the stage for WW3. At this point it appears as though the only thing can be done is unilateral sanctions by individual countries, but from what I've read, more invested countries in the area, such as vietnam and Japan, are unlikely to impose unilateral sanctions because of their vested interests within Myanmar. Whereas the US does not have much of a vested interest or presence at all, sanctions imposed by the US will have little impact. Furthermore, unilateral sanctions are more likely to negatively impact the civilian population rather than the junta. 

So, in essence, you are entirely correct that humanitarian rights/law is actively being violated, the perpetrators of such can be subjected to universal jurisdiction under the Geneva Conventions, namely under Article 3. But, as you said in your first statement that you feel as though China is blocking protection of the civilian population, your feeling would appear to be entirely accurate.

From all I've read up to this point, until an armed group large enough to pose a threat to the junta and can be considered an ""insurgency"", it doesn't look like China has any real obligation to backpedal on its current standpoint to allow a counter-insurgency. Even if an insurgency were to be established, which side China would take is anybody's guess."
603,mj2mcn,66,4,Do you also know what other business interests that China has in Myanmar? Why are we asking for global arms embargo and eliminating illicit drug trades in Myanmar?
604,mj2mcn,68,2,"I didn't say it was a major motivation for anything that the Chinese government is doing. It is, however, a factual observation. About ⅓ of the resources produced by Myanmar is from natural gas.

Thank you for providing additional information!"
605,mj2mcn,71,1,"What do you do when the bot responds, licker of boots?"

Mr Kasit Piromya, former Thai Minister of Foreign Affairs explains very clearly the involvement of China in our affairs.  If you want to know further, the onus is on you to go find out more rigorous literature published by various autonomous universities around the world mentioning about this."
607,mj2mcn,76,2,"I am not sure about the arm part with Russia (I'm no military expert), but the rest is pretty accurate. I won't call that intervention tho (building ports pipelines and railways are investments, not interventions). All these actions happened mostly under NLD, not the dictatorship preceding it. Does China have a stake in Myanmar’s situation? Yes. But that interest isn't necessarily malicious and one-sided."
608,mj2mcn,77,2,"Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99904% sure that Tan_Lee_Gnot is not a bot.

609,mj2mcn,79,1,"I do not disagree with your sentiment. However, I feel inclined to point out, however insensitive it may sound (truly no offense or harm intended), that that the law, as it's written, does not consider any one person's opinions or viewpoints as justification for violating the same laws. In the United States we have the 8th amendment, which protects an individual from ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

As you've stated, ""I would preferably refrain from violence."" This statement only reiterates the necessity for people like yourself, as well as other like-minded Individuals, to prevail."
610,mj2mcn,83,1,"As you wish,I may follow."
611,mj2mcn,84,7,"Burma is geo politically very important for China. This is a known facts that everyone who are familiar with international politics and global affair. There are many ways China involved in Myanmar politics obvious one is supporting armed ethnic groups for insurgencies. Democratic and peaceful multi interests independent Myanmar will make a difficult field for China to compete with the west, Japanese and the OIC countries. In that scenario, China will not get special favor like while dealing with the illegitimate regime. I have a lot of optimism on China based on what our leader mentioned before she was detained. She said China is truly a good friend and a good neighbor to Myanmar. I was expecting China to send clear message to the inhumane behaviors of the junta will not be tolerated in today’s world. But when China issue statement to protect its business (merely 5 garment factories) while ignoring the loss of hundred of lives, I have to lower my expectations on China to be a moral leader to save our declining humanity. It is time for China to reconsider its foreign policy to be more human oriented than its own interest protected. If China wants to be in leading role in the world, now is the best time to show its good will. I believe for the very reason central Asian and African nations are not very happy with self-centered Chinese investments around the world. 
So China please use your gigantic power to spread peace, prosperity, justice and promote our shared humanity above your self economics and poltical interest in this kind of difficult time. I am sure you will get the respect and loving kindness from the rest of the world in return."

643,lz10do,77,1,We still have shields for close quarters combat. rarely used for clearing buildings but offers more protection then body armor since body armor only protects your chest and back. Flanking isn’t a problem when you’re standing in a hallway or doorway and you don’t need to worry about APCs in a building. Usually it’s police forces vs criminals using small arms which the shields can protect against.

646,lz10do,91,1,"Yea,but for  every 1000 shots fired, at least 1 is live ammunition"
647,lz10do,92,1,"Well, sure, shields have niche use in military/police context, eg, CQB, house clearing; though if collateral damage is less of an issue, frag then clear will be default. Shield allows for some protection and covers in stretches inside a building without covers: hallways, staircase and carries by a pointman.

I was referring to flanking and APC faced by the protestors and shield in general military use. Military probably can use a true bullet resistant shield in niche situations like gunshields on mounted MGs on vehicles or a smaller shield attached to a rifle or MG that allows the user to be more protected when firing aimed shots over covers or from a prone position. Currently, without such protection, troops pinned down by automatic fire can only return aimed fire while exposing their face, throat, and head. Often, they are suppressed if the fire is accurate. With a shield attached to a rifle or MG that exposes only a small slit for sights, sufficiently motived troops can actually fire back somewhat. FOV is bad, but a properly setup defensive position will have narrow fields of fire for each man anyway."
648,lz10do,95,1,That's saying if every single citizen had a gun and fought they might need 20% just to save on time.
649,lz10do,98,3,"They haven't banned social media...lots of FB, IG, tiktoks, and tweets still coming through on the regular."
650,lz10do,105,1,Make sure you have the shields afixxed so they can be abandoned fast. Unlike the Romans your enemy has guns that can pierce them. Also have people in your rear who's job it is to tighten the formation. Also have them armed with long polls for pushing between the shields if cracks form so they can push police/mill back out of the gaps. Ide recommend watching police drill videos for inspiration on what to drill for and also ensure your signals can be passed on in any sound environment. Best thing to do is ensure that in the worst case you have everyone passing it on in the ranks.
651,lz10do,109,1,"Yeah man. If you have the money for it. Also SWAT team armored vehicles are usually rated at a NIJ Type IV armor rating. This means that they can stop a certain amount of most rifle rounds. However, after multiple hits in the same or close to the same spot, the armor will weaken and allow bullets to pass through. So in reality, if 3 dudes mag dumped their ARs into the windshield of one of these trucks, they would probably get through the windshield pretty quick."
652,lz10do,111,2,Imagine not remembering that the US has signed a peace treaty with the Taliban just one year ago.
653,lz10do,114,1,A small percentage of the us military is actually engaged in the fight against taliban and that’s on foreign territory and they don’t want to kill too many civilians. Quite different from a domestic civil war.

But to verify.

This isn’t pictures from just one incident right? Like maybe it all happened at the same time. But these are multiple families, multiple houses torched, multiple people and possibly in the same town / village / area?

Like they just basically tried to just clear out a whole inhabited settlement .
Obviously non militants all innocent civilians who just want a normal life and work a 9-5 and go home. I see children so of course they are young. But the older victims are just normal people trying to live normal lives? 

Cause I always see shit trying to get spun.
Awe they were helping the enemy’s. Holding ammo or weapons or giving info to get the government troops attacked whatever . 

Just FYI I have been personally diving into this stuff in Myanmar for along time so I’m well aware of what’s going on and who’s doing what and why and what not.

But like, 

I can’t believe this shit (well for one, is even happening, has happened, ) but I just can’t believe that it’s still going on like this, to this day. I thought it all died down. 
But fuck .

Fucking bastards . 
Why has the west stood by and let so many people who just wanted a democratic society . 
Get pushed into genocide. 

You always see how we go to war, and wage so many military conflicts because we want to “bring democracy” but like previous wars and examples. The people simply just didn’t want it. Among many other things.
But we go to war and have so many lives lost trying to bring peace and democracy. 

And Myanmar literally broke out into a civil war / coup . Because they got screwed and cheated out of elections and lost power of the people, lost democracy, lost peace, lost the hood and opportunities to prosper as a nation.

A perfect if not the best type of example, one could go in, kicking doors guns blazing, to “save the world” to help, to bring peace and democracy.

And we’ve just fucking stood back and watched as an untold amount of innocent lives got brutally and horrifically murdered to the point people are saying the word genocide .
It blows my mind. 
I love and hate the way the world works .
Look at Afghanistan , 
Myanmar actually shows the signs that it would be so much more beneficial to invest resources and time and lives into protecting. 
On a morally standpoint. 
I can get I to the specifics if anyone’s interested.

But that would also assume those in power who get to make these decisions have the people in best interests  at mind, and not some other thing that only has $ in mind."

856,12idltl,148,1,"Maybe because there are so many militias in my country representing various ethnic groups that might turn onto each other if the fall of the military regime creates a powrr vacuum. Currently, they're all fighting the regime but some of them have a bit of tensions with a few other ethnic groups.

Also, the possibility of China to intervene if the war spills across Chinese borders. Currently, they have had talks with both the regime and various ethnic militias for business deals and possible de-escalation, apparently. However, if the war gets to the point where the militia or the regime or anyone starts making incursions into the Chinese border, they might intervene. (I'm saying this because China has a history of intervening in the Korean war and invading Vietnam)

I think if our representatives can present a viable and attractive revolution and post-revolution roadmap both US and China, we may be able to get more support from the west and also make sure China doesn't intervene. (and btw, the west is currently giving us support via diplomacy, asylum, and humanitarian aid) However, trying to forge a coalition between the militias (and everyone who's fighting the regime) seems to have proved harder than expected.

My guess is that if the war starts overwhelming tipping in favor of the resistance, China will stop engaging with the regime and increase engagement with the resistance. China deals with the regime because the regime still controls many regions of Myanmar and is still resourceful. In regions where the regime has no power, China deals with ethnic armed organizations (think of UWSA or Northeastern Myanmar). China do what they think will benefit them the most.

There is very little chance of China sending in their military to keep the regime from falling. On the other hand, that is what Russia might actually do."

862,12idltl,161,1,The Myanmar military controls all the key cities and highways. It is only the forests and villages where the opposition enjoys some territorial control.

In that case, I guess the bible is evidence that Jesus was ""already dead""

Edit: Despite this being a mostly tongue in cheek comment, you can also take the line ""just like Jesus"" to mean ""yeah, Jesus was dead too, and he came back and started fucking shit up, so don't chat shit about God's power my dude"" so it doesn't all have to be negative :)"

Although it seems that India have fell asleep at the wheel for a while and let CCP get ahead of the game and are now playing a game of catch up. I suppose Tatmadaw will take a leaf out of CCPs book and play these rivals against each other taking advantage of the situation as tensions in Ladakh escalate and the rivalry in Myanmar investments becomes of môre strategic value.

It seems that Tatmadaw have made a very big mistake with the coup as everything was going relatively well for them and all their crimes against humanity were going under the radar. They didn't even face serious consequences for the Rohingya genocide from the international community. Which was a huge failing from the west as it seems to have emboldened them to think they can get away with such atrocities and thought their would be less repercussions with the coup."

It would seem that the military regime announced its resumption in hope of Chinese support — China has yet to openly endorse it because they seem to be aware of the negative optics.

On another note, she did try to do the story justice, so kudos for that,  but she can't act like she's first to report.

Though most of what she reported is the same as other Western media as well, she managed to give an exclusive interview and we all enjoyed watching the general looking like a deer caught in headlights.

As to how she got invited, are you thinking of some conspiracy? Like CNN pays millions of dollars to the military go get in? But I'm not sure if they would take the risk of that information leaking out. That's the only inexcusable thing I can think of. Anyway, I don't really care for conspiracies.

Look, why are even comparing here? I don't see any good out of having disdain for a certain journalist because we think they didn't do as well as others, esp since said journalist credits the others too. Sure, maybe other reports are better in quality but CNN is better in dramatisation xD which is good for exposure to the general populations.

Anyway, we're on the same side here, you and I. And I don't really feel like we need to compare and criticize any journalist for reporting this. I've made my point don't see the use of furthering this debate either, so I'll just bid you a good day."

The situation in Myanmar is about democracy and freedom, the right for the people to lead through their own elected representatives without foreign interference, from my point of view, this has more to do with America than Britain. 

Admittedly, if Myanmar was in the commonwealth help *might* come from Canada, U.K., New Zealand etc and the commonwealth is much more chill now (allowing republics and stuff), but when Myanmar left republics weren't allowed, there were likely more reasons to leave (not that that isn't reason enough) but I'm definitely not well read on the history of Myanmar.

Also (assuming this guy is a nationalist), he probably supports Brexit. One of the main ""attractive"" points of Brexit is more independence from a group of many nations that some say doesn't give us enough freedom (the EU is better than the commonwealth of the 40s and Britain used to be able to vote through Members of European Parliament)."

During this period there was movements towards democracy. But so many influences from past groups of indian/Chinese and ethnic groups.agreement was always short lived .It is a very complex history of internal conflict.Any one interested should check google:Myanmar on Wikipedia."

1138,m6ctnz,22,44,"judging from the lower left currency being 冥通銀行 ""issued"", I think the rest of them are fake ""hell money"" as well. It's a kind of folk religion practice to give the departed currency to ""spend"" in the afterlife. Sort of like a coin on your eyes to pay the ferryman, except everything in the afterlife costs money too. Don't think about the hell economy and inflation too hard, it's a way for grieving family to provide for their loved ones and keep their memory alive.

1140,m6ctnz,24,3,"It’s called ‘Hell Money’. A Chinese tradition dating back centuries. Chinese believe the dead go down to be judged on their previous life and there are layers of hell depending on your sins/ merits.

Good souls can go to heaven. Some are reborn. Some souls have to stay longer. Don’t ask how long as no one really knows but they need money to buy food, services etc just like you would on Earth.

It’s not just money but figurines representing servants and maids are burnt, gold bars, clothing, housing, cars, latest mobile phones,etc are all burnt. All these items are made out of paper. This is so that they have a good afterlife.

This tradition is a mixture of aspects between Taoism and Buddhism which is practised to this day. The Chinese really respect and honour their dead even after they’ve gone."
1141,m6ctnz,29,1,"He isn't ethnic Chinese. I found out on facebook his mother is Dehong Dai, born in Shan States. If you look up Dehong Dai, it is a Shan dialect, they are Shan people, from Chinese side of the border. On these borders, Shans, Kachins, Was, Palongs, etc move freely across borders, just like Chins who cross Burma-India border. Dr. Sasa who is Chin moved from Chin State to India to get his education as an example. 

Historically, Dais or Thai people, and Tibeto-Burman people have been migrating from what's known today as China for more than 2000 years for various reasons including pressure from the dominant Hans, and continues to do so today. So they are the late arrivals of our peoples."

1147,m6ctnz,44,1,Emara..what is the script you add to your comments? Is it ethnic Malay?
1148,m6ctnz,46,3,"Glad that you ask. It is a long story. I assume you are Chinese so I will explain Parallel to Qing Dynasty and the start of the century of humiliation. China has like the Chinese Chamber of commerce in Myanmar. It is the same as What the British did in HK and the century of humiliation. That Chamber of commerce as a  first-class citizen in Myanmar while we citizen of Myanmar are treated third or second class in our own country. They collude with the Myanmar military which is like the Qing dynasty who didn't dare to industrialize China because they will need to educate and empower the mass han population and it will be the end of their dynasty. So is the Myanmar Military, they didn't dare to educate or give democracy in Myanmar or it will be the end of military dictatorship. btw, Myanmar Junta hired an Israeli lobbyist with 2 million dollars. The money came from the Chinese Chamber of commerce account when it was traced. This group did all sorts of things to prop up Dictatorship in Myanmar in return. The junta gave him all sort of preferential treatment. They become first-class citizens in Myanmar. Whether it is mining jade or other resources it is the CHina who owns them all. It is like how British is the first-class citizen in Hong Kong. They start to pull like No Burmese allowed in their restaurant or business in Myanmar like How the British did in HK "" no Chinese or dogs allowed sign in HK"" in the century of humiliation. just Yesterday, a Chinese employer summoned a Myanmar employee to make a payment. but he didn't pay the promised amount and he called the soldiers to shoot the employees when they demand the promised amount. 5 deaths 70 arrested, 4 more death later. Chinese embassy and Beijing cover up all their corruption and neo-colony style dealing in their media in turn, they support the dictator in Myanmar. btw the Japan Chamber of commerce did the same. They tried to pull the same shit as the Chinese group did. But when the truth is surfaced, Japan's foreign ministry didn't cover-up. They give us Justice. that is the fking difference. also, the Chinese embassador to Myanmar is a fkiing corrupted shit. The way he manage the relationship in Myanmar is just giving a hand to CIA campaign against smearing China."

Russia role seems to be more prominent as they send in a deputy defense minister, and also explicitly voiced support for the Junta, while China is still being careful on maintaining their vague position and interest.

So yeah, even if China caved in to the pressure and agree to the UN resolution, it will be futile because Russia is still there.

Also, regarding the veto use, China's excuse is they always oppose any intervention policy and support sovereignty more. I haven't read much on China (and Russia)'s veto use yet, but there are many free research journals if you want to read more on that.

Just from simple google search, i already found these 3. If you put a little more time in it, i'm sure you will found more study cases and analysis that is more relevant to current situation.

I can understand why ASSK defended the Tatmadaw back then, if she didn't,  the coup would probably had happened much earlier. The longer she stays in Parliament, the more she could do more for her people. It was choosing the lesser evil. That decision backfired on her on 1st Feb 2021.

NLD's mistake was trying to oust the Tatmadaw out of Burmese political arena bit by bit. Their plan was to reduced the Tatmadaw's percentage in the Parliament by 5% to 10% each election. The Tatmadaw has been in the Political arena since the 1960s or earlier. It would be wiser to work with them slowly to get the full democracy instead of trying to oust them out completely.

Write leaders of Myanmar’s major trading/political partners (e.g., China, India, Thailand, Indonesia) and urge them to:

-Speak out publicly against the coup

-Offer assistance to Myanmar government to return to Democracy

-Enact sanctions against top Myanmar military leaders and key Myanmar businesses.

The plus side is as long as you have powder a muzzle loaded shotgun can shoot just about anything, rocks, ball bearings, etc., and use fabric or even plant leaves or brush as wadding. Proper lead shot and purpose made wads are preferable, but might be hard to come by. Improvised ammo can limit range by quite a bit because of lower density, and less consistent patterns.

Self defence helps. Sometimes you gotta learn to **disarm** the situation. If the whole crazy situation is base on a lie, bring the truth. I mean if I was living in truth, I would reason and show proof instead of forcing my ""perspective"" on others, especially from the barrel of the gun, especially if I am suppose to show ""leadership"". Any nuttcase can take a life, it takes a true Human Being to save one. In more ways than one.

Get weird among other methods, sometimes humour and critical thinking helps snap people back to reality, and not drag them into some ""leaders"" crazy view of the world.

1346,mwak31,44,2,Yeah I agree. Companies doing business with Myanmar army should be penalized. It looks like they are already facing the scrutiny which is a great thing. Hope this continues with all companies doing business with the Myanmar military.

1349,mwak31,56,3,"It depends on how much the person is exposed to the ""real"" World.

Not many adults have seen the real gory part of the war unless you are on active duty and had been deployed to a war zone.

Some are in the opinion that those who had signed up, it is their duty to serve and fight. No doubt about that.

What if the war drags on or WW3 starts? Those who are keen to send troops, do they realised that if they are of military age, they can be drafted and send to fight? Their friends and even family members could also be drafted to fight."
1350,mwak31,61,1,And how exactly did those sanctions work out for the Burmese post 88?
1351,mwak31,63,1,"Post 88 the san actions resulted in the junta introducing a measure of democracy in 2015 as well as freeing ASSK.  They worked until February 1, 2021.  Some  sanctions were relaxed by Obama. 

The junta didn’t dare a coup under Trump (who added new sanctions).  As soon as Biden too over, the junta did the coup which it had been planning since 2015.  Biden’s weakness does indeed embolden the junta.  

I responded to what do I the west and by inclusion the USA to do.  

You will note that I didn’t say the USA would actually do it."

1377,mkliki,0,1,This is unverified it is from Elon Musk but I will leave it up here.
1378,mkliki,6,12,The rule in America is you can do whatever you want until the government says you can’t; that’s how American laws work. And that’s why we (for the most part) “are free.” If you want to do it - then do it ... you don’t need the governments permission. You only can not do it when they say it’s been made illegal. .... that’s the fundamental aspect of having a constitution and a free society..... so yeah .. I call BS on Elon Musk .... I hope he proves me wrong ....
1379,mkliki,10,10,They advertise their package plan at Myanmar since January and the cost will be 99USD per month but the service will be available at 2022. Even only preorder isn't sure for now.
1380,mkliki,15,8,Yea... ok

1388,mkliki,28,13,"The email address looks like it may be his. We may send him a letter or two. Just not too much, we do not want to piss him off."
1389,mkliki,29,6,Should I flair it as possibly fake?
1390,mkliki,33,4,Imagine if Elon sends in AI sentinels to Myanmar to help the protesters.
1391,mkliki,34,1,"Get it to Kanchanaburi and I can get it in. I got 140 rattan chairs from Ikea into the country. Needed then on short notice after our Myanmar supplier cancelled our order a week before our big grand opening. No one in Myanmar could fulfill an order that large on such short notice. Thankfully, Ikea could, and they were right over in Bangkok. 

Problem was, import tax on rattan furniture of really high in Myanmar, to help the local producers. These chairs were already twice the cost of our original order, and all the import shit would have added another 40% to that. So we made some arrangements with a driver and gave him plenty of gifts in beer, cigarettes and whiskey to give to the border guards at one of the most remote border crossings where they can't just go by that stuff during their lunch break, these guys only go home once a week. That was that.

140 chairs arrived as if they were purchased right in town. I can get the equipment in. 

Unfortunately the military just outlawed satellite dishes though, so placement once in the country is more the issue then getting them in."
1392,mkliki,36,2,when did that happen?
1393,mkliki,37,1,"That was a business decision which provided a financial benefit. 

This similarly, could be a business decision which provides a financial benefit.

The Bolivian situation was slightly more nuanced with a large number of supporters for both governments around the world if I remember correctly. Whereas the Myanmar Military id universally viewed as evil around the world. UN fact finding missions have found them guilty of genocide on multiple occasions (two different ethnic groups) and committing crimes against humanity. Only reason there's no UN coalition on the ground is because China didn't want to anger the military, as they are currently guarding gas pipelines that run into China, which have been targets for activists, and Russia wants to keep messing money selling them arms, and unfortunately the two countries that benefit the most from this also happen to be two of the biggest seats in the UNSBut yeah, otherwise, these guys are seen as evil around the world and if Starlink could say that one of their first major uses was tookeep democratic activists connected to each other and to the outside world amidst an authoritarian internet blackout by an illegitimate government... Well, I'm pretty sure returning freedom and democracy to a country and preventing further genocide there is certainly one way to win over customers and get the money rolling in."
1394,mkliki,41,8,"Low cost pr. He is doing great things yet all billionaires are or were assholes. You dong get that kinda money by being a good person. Just imagine the headlines. Elon musk's starlink helps Myanmar overthrow military junta.

Or ""Musk's technology saves Myanmar"" 

An article of this sort

""On the military junta last effort to censorship the Burmese billionaire filantropist, demigod Elon Musk provided resistance protestors with solar roofs power walls and starlink internet free of censorship to open a window to the world. Showing us the brutality of the junta."" 

I mean... You can't get for a couple of sat dishes and few thousand dollars of equipment this kind of press normally. Search puerto rico huracán maria and elon musk he provided some solar panels, enough to take credit. And offer to be the contractor fo the us to rebuild the islands energy grid. (He got the PR but failed the contract)

Possible, yes. Likely, on the fence but not as widespread if yes. Done for the democracy, most likely.. not."

1398,mkliki,50,5,Go to one of those subreddits
1399,mkliki,51,13,The best would be if some news media comfirmed it with him. Later on some other mail from him may appear but we again won't be sure if it's really from him.

There was a similar scenario with Morinho"
1401,mkliki,54,1,"Tesla is trying to eliminate cobalt in their battery chemistry, which is not a small task."
1402,mkliki,55,8,Actually he owns SpaceX which has those satellites. Tesla only makes cars.
1403,mkliki,59,1,Starlink is not in geosynchronous orbit it is in low earth orbit which means the satellites move around the planet so he would not need special satellites for myanmar

1406,mkliki,66,2,"He probably will not shoot his workers like the military does, so the deal is still good."
1407,mkliki,69,4,"He could do it for a few people atleast to help them stay connected, like maybe a thousand. But how do you get internet equipment into Myanmar?"
1408,mkliki,70,3,"We shell see, I hope you're wrong

Tesla helped Puerto Rico few years back after heavy damage from hurricane, can't see how they wouldn't help Myanmar the similar way"
1409,mkliki,73,1,The constellation is not complete yet. Obviously outages are a problem but inconsistent internet is better than no internet. Things can be uploaded and downloaded when connections become available. Even 10% uptime would be a significant boost for any resistance.

1414,md4h6j,27,2,Myanmar sent invitations to 47 countries for today’s military parade. Only 2 countries agreed to attend: China and Russia. This can explain everything~
1415,md4h6j,28,1,Look it up. China and the Burmese military have a good relationship. Please read my post. I never claimed they killed anyone in the HK protest. I said China is corrupt which is obvious. China is involved in Myanmar's affairs... Just helping the military instead of stopping them.

All donations to MAM are tax-deductible for United States tax payers (other countries vary). While the IRS processes our 501(c)(3) tax exemption application, donations can be made through our Fiscal sponsor, Friends of Pariaman. Friends of Pariaman is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization that is serving as Mutual Aid Myanmar’s fiscal sponsor while the IRS processes our application. Any donations to MAM will list Friends of Pariaman as the recipient.

One-hundred percent of all donations made to Friends of Pariaman in care of MAM go straight to MAM’s programs. Friends of Pariaman’s mission aligns closely with that of MAM, so they are happy to help out."""

I have doubts my explaining this to you any further will change your mind as it seems you never entered this thread to learn anything new.  However, in the event things were still not clear to you, here is a final summary:

Civilians in Myanmar are participating in CDM to pressure the military.  This is a powerful protest tool but it can be hampered by people having to stop due to lack of funds.  Expats and other concerned international persons are encouraged to help by donating to CDMs.  It is difficult to transfer money individually if you are an outsider, therefore people who do have a trusted contact have volunteered to collect the funds and transfer them.  It's the same idea as if an office colleague was collecting money in an office drive to gift to another sick colleague in hospital - its to simplify the collection and delivery and not to take a cut.  

It's unfortunate if you don't understand this, or have never had the opportunity to witness people working honestly and selflessly for others.  I hope that changes for you."

Well, within 30 minutes you can

* Share this instruction with your friends, see what is happening in Myanmar right now, and send some of the news in popular subreddits, translate one news into your language and share on social networks or in the local community, and have a coffee.

Or

* Print / draw some flyers and distribute them in the neighboring houses.

Or

* Draw a poster with any title you like and ""#SaveMyanmar"" or ""#HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar"", and go get some fresh air outside.

1576,o5npr8,16,3,"In a press conference held in London on 27 August 1969, U Nu announced that he was the 'legal Prime Minister' and 'pledged to the people of Burma' that he would not give up his struggle for democracy in Burma and that Burma was under the 'same kind of fascism' which (Burma's independence hero) 'General Aung San had fought' (during the freedom struggle and the resistance against the Japanese occupation of Burma during the Second World War, including both U Nu and Ne Win as his companions). The full text of U Nu's press conference in London can be read in the 1 September 1969 issues of the Rangoon Guardian and the Working People's Daily. The text of U Nu's press conference announcement, made in English, in London, was also translated into Burmese in full and was published in all the State-controlled Burmese language newspapers of 1 September 1969.[citation needed]

U Nu then used former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Bill Young to help him raise international funding for founding the United National Liberation Front (UNLF). By the end of 1970, they had garnered more than $2 million.[7]

U Nu later formed the Parliamentary Democracy Party (PDP) and led an armed resistance group. U Nu's 'resistance group' consisted of no more than several hundred or at most a few thousand at its peak and his avowal to fight and overthrow Ne Win from the Thai border met with abject failure. He subsequently accepted an offer of amnesty granted by Ne Win and returned to Burma on 29 July 1980. (The news item that ""former Prime Minister U Nu and wife Mya Yi arrving [sic?] back at Rangoon airport at 3:30 pm in the afternoon of 29 July 1980"" can be read in the 30 July 1980 issues of the Rangoon Guardian and the Working People's Dail"

1583,lxmksu,15,2,"Those who are on the ground are fighting back to some degree, with slingshots mostly, and I was proud to be on the line when we forced a full police retreat. We were not as organized as this though. None of us knew each other minutes before, and there were only a few people with shields.

Mostly we were not fighting the police, but just trying to push them back enough so we could continue our march down the planned route keeping them far away from an intersection where we would turn, so that they could not reach the intersection with tear gas. A lot of attention was focused on neutralizing tear gas.

Besides the threat to protestors, some who are elderly themselves, its been getting into crowded apartments above the narrow streets where older people who have respiratory problems are now suffering. Many are poor and have no a/c and it is unbearable to close the windows this time of year of you don't have a/c.

But I understand your frustration with us not being more offensive. People are getting shot in the head by snipers for just marching in the road. Marching in the streets, that alone won't accomplish much. There is much I would like to do, but as a foreigner, I stand out and would be easily tracked down.

That being said, I totally agree with the assessment that her and the NLD dropped the proverbial ball and placated the army when they should have confronted them (about the Rohingya and other ongoing atrocities), and later (in regards to the retirement age issue/discussion) she confronted them when she should have placated them."

Then again, myanmar army is like low value currency exchange rate. Look at how a lot of the soldiers handle their weapons.

Btw, what did the last photo says?"
1656,m0doec,19,12,Which rank do they normally obtain after finishing DSA?
1657,m0doec,21,2,One of the profile photos says Captain.
1658,m0doec,27,3,Father.
1659,m0doec,28,3,It means “dad”
1660,m0doec,29,1,"It says ""Dad"""
1661,m0doec,30,2,He is right. Han Zaw Htun used to serve under division 77th. Latest news mentioned that he is now under division 55th.
1662,m0doec,31,1,What’s her name
1663,m0doec,33,1,"Infantry always gets promoted the quickest in myanmar military. All other divisions start at 2LT and takes them 3-4 years to go up 1 rank as they mostly do office work and just training. 

Infantry on the other hand had to actively fight the civil war with the Karens in the north. Whenever they survive a deployment they get promoted. The death toll there is pretty high though around 80-90%. Takes less than a year to rank up."
1664,m0doec,35,1,I think it's his hands and feet.
1665,m0doec,38,1,"He is not Lieutenant General, but a Captain. I can see the rank and tell."
1666,m0doec,39,9,"It means ""Dad""."
1667,m0doec,41,4,"Infantry always gets promoted the quickest in myanmar military. Everyone starts out at 2LT after ocs and takes them 3-4 years to go up 1 rank as they mostly do office work and routine training. 

Infantry on the other hand had to actively fight the civil war with the Karens in the north. Whenever they survive a deployment they get promoted. The death toll there is pretty high though around 80-90%. Takes less than a year to rank up.

I'm not sure about now but people used to joined the military once they finished their 10th grade at age 16-17 since myanmar public schools did not have a 12 year system previously. Basically if you passed your O level equivalent you qualify for ocs. If you flunked u start out as a corporal. If your education level never reached 10th grade you start out as a private."
1668,m0doec,42,1,"They have got 1 star, second Lieutenant after Graduated from DSA. And they will get another star to Lieutenant after a year, and another star after 3 years and become Captain like that Kid in the photo.  

Actually he is not Lieutenant General."
1669,m0doec,43,1,"Yea, the 6th one."
1670,m0doec,45,2,"Add in the 'Right to Bear Arms'. Only a disarmed populace can be oppressed, an armed populace is a formidable force. Don't believe me? Look at KNU protected protests. Let everybody arm themselves."
1671,m0doec,46,3,Shwe Yupar Oo
1672,m0doec,48,5,"there are actually a lot of captains, the officer college graduates always start with  Lt /captain equivalent rank."
1673,m0doec,49,1,"the death toll isn't that high. Also, Karen is in the south and south east. North is KIA. There is no major war with Karen for like a decade now. Most recent deadly battles are fought in Rakhine and North against AA and TNLA which are also new armed groups, even then Death toll is around 20% for officer"
1674,m0doec,57,4,"We need to get the Right to Bear Arms into our new constitution.

[The Right to Bear Arms will help prevent a new coup.](https://www.2anys.com/2021/03/the-myanmar-coup-and-mass-murder-shows-why-we-need-the-right-to-bear-arms/)"
1675,m0doec,60,3,"yep pretty much, not too small though, its just like second Lt in US."
1676,m0doec,62,5,">The Right to Bear Arms will help prevent a new coup.

You would think that this is one of the most important right to be included in the constitution but currently, there are only three countries that have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms: **Mexico**, **Guatemala**, and **the United States.**"
1677,m0doec,70,4,"I agree with you but I was surprised to know that only three countries out of the entire world take it seriously to put it into their constitution. 

I only know Dr. Sasa ([https://twitter.com/DrSasa22222](https://twitter.com/DrSasa22222)) on twitter."
1678,mjoqbx,1,10,"It's in Bago City, as I heard the first person shouted in march. Bago is near Yangon 2 hours drive away."
1679,mjoqbx,11,1,There’s a reason it’s undisclosed my man

1691,m07af7,36,1,That was a very interesting read. Do you think there is a chance for this contractors (the badass ones) to end up in Myanmar and help the civilians agains the military? Also did these guys go to Hong Kong during the protests? Ir maybe there wasn’t an interest there?

How would that affect CCP policies at the UN, weapon supplies to both sides and the movements of tens of thousands of PLA troops and military vehicles now massing in Ruili/Jeigao just across the border?"

1697,mojrsv,11,2,"During the revolution 0n 8.8.88, there was also no intervention from any foreign nations or the UN. 

It will be likely the same scenario this time round.

If you look at the revolutions like the America Revolution, French Revolution, Cuban Revolution, etc, throughout our history, there is little or no help from a foreign nation."

1699,mojrsv,14,0,"There are sixteen million other things the USA can do, including putting pressure on China and Russia. International politics is 16-D chess and everything affects everything else. If the USA really wanted to intervene, they could - military intervention is NOT the only solution."
