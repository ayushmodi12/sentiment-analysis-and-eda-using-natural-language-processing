1,m94ryl,2,16,"I hope all the brave people finally win over these scums from the military , best of wishes to all in Myanmar fighting for their rights and democracy , full support from another human and currently a resident of India"
2,m94ryl,10,3,May God bless all brave and peaceful Myanmar  people.
3,m94ryl,12,2,I bet you Palestinian mothers do the same. I wish them safety and an end to the oppression.
4,m94ryl,14,2,"I pray to God that they may return home safely without a scratch on their bodies. Do not give up, people of Myanmar, even though I know saying all this is equivalent of being useless, keep going people."
5,m94ryl,15,2,"This is why i fully support the 2nd amendment in the US. A well armed and regulated militia should always be on stand by for the people. It wouldn't be easy, it wouldnt be pretty, but it would give people a fighting chance at standing up against a corrupt government. God speed"
6,m94ryl,20,2,Who gave this wholesome award
7,m94ryl,22,1,Ahh this is great to watch as a Muslim

10,m94ryl,35,1,Brave people
11,m94ryl,36,1,"As a Burmese-born (but foreign raised) guy, my heart is total with you.  I hope you succeed in gaining the freedom you so deserve."
12,m94ryl,39,1,"These parents raised good sons and daughters. Big respect! 

Also, this also shows that it is really the youth who are the hope of every nation."
13,m94ryl,40,1,Fighting the good fight. 😢
14,m94ryl,47,1,Respect ✊
15,m94ryl,48,1,🙏🙏🙏🙏
16,m94ryl,93,1,I feel like this is so valid. It feels exactly like how the pandemic made me wonder how we are still arguing private healthcare.
17,m94ryl,94,1,"Thanks, I am gonna go through all of this info. Appreciate that you put them all in one place."
18,m94ryl,128,2,"Ikr this is such a family bonding activity, they should bring the cat and the dog too. /S"
19,m94ryl,133,1,And I see your sub numbers growing.  So it seems people are following the cross-post and coming over.
20,m94ryl,145,1,"This is probably the best point I've seen raised this whole time. I'm probably more supportive of American interventionism than you, but this is still damn relevant. I don't see a problem being the world police \*IF\* we actually do it to support the spread of freedom, peace, self-determination of the public, enforcing human rights (one of which is voting which is relevant here). IF those are the reasons we do things, that's grand, but you're correct that there is no evidence in our past actions that support that as a cause of our intervention. It has usually been greed. I will end by saying to be careful when you criticize American interventionism, and consider that we are not the only nation capable of engaging in it. Look just how rough things have gotten with the Uyghurs/HKong and again with the Crimea when these States smell blood in the water. tl;dr anti-interventionists be careful what you wish for."
21,m94ryl,159,1,"As an egyptian, yes, yes i would"
22,m94ryl,164,1,[https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m9mf0r/background\_on\_the\_current\_coup\_in\_burma/](https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m9mf0r/background_on_the_current_coup_in_burma/) has more content and more organized
23,m94ryl,177,1,"One more time I have demonstrated that a sling is much more powerful (comparable to 9mm) has further range easier and cheaper to make and no doubt better than the marbles you guys are shooting. Dont be emotional because I called them Dennis the menace sling shots then not be able to objectively listen to what I am saying. Go back to previous posts and tell me exactly how a slingshot is better than a sling. Why did David slay goliath with a sling and not a slingshot? Why did ancient armies use slings and not slingshots. The only time armies used sling shot in past is a ballista and that was minimum 2 man crew served weapon. Can average people use a sling shot to hit 250+ m with marbles like your doing now? A sling can. Just in case you missed my post with information. I'll post it here again.

please use these https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/david-s-sling-14395020.jpg and stop using the dennis the menace sling shots they are useless compared to a sling. ditch the roman candles for truck tires that are stuffed with rags and diesel fuel and roll them down the street into their lines while raining down slugs from the sling. Even better melt some lead into oblong shapes with sharp ends. like the ones shown here https://youtu.be/2etapZX5k-Y?t=14 and when your out of that lead shot starting using stones. 100x more range and 100x more deadly then dennis the menace sling shots and marbles lol. Also arguably easier to make. The range alone compared to shitty marble is enough.

regular guy slinging 250 m https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hs19_2tiSZw

you can drill holes in the shot to make them whistle and reduce their morale .. much scarier than silent ones and more likely to make the line break formation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXzuO1tU25I

is a sling as powerful as a gun? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BehBbNQRjXw"
24,m94ryl,182,1,I concur
25,m94ryl,208,1,Hell of a lot easier with actual weapons
26,m94ryl,219,1,"Yes, if someone from Canada wants to get their surgery quicker, and they are rich enough, they should be able to come here, where you can only get surgeries or medicines you need if you have plenty of money. The healthcare system is not bogged down by poor people here, and can attend to the rich instantly. Exactly as it should be. Totally agree."
27,m94ryl,224,1,"HA! Fair enough, my man."
28,m94ryl,252,3,Too much interest there for resources. Burma is golden land and so are its people. Truly beautiful
29,m94ryl,263,1,">The healthcare system is not bogged down by poor people here, and can attend to the rich instantly. Exactly as it should be.

Wait, what? Are you advocating for the rich to get better health care access?"
30,m94ryl,287,2,That's my guy!
31,m94ryl,310,1,American cool aid taste way better.
32,m94ryl,322,1,"Oh, thank goodness. 

Yeah some people think that the 10% having access to top notch medical care is somehow better than everyone having reasonable access"
33,m94ryl,340,1,Winning against a nations army is the easy part. We took out Iraq’s army in literally days during desert storm. We’re good at that. It’s insurgents that are problematic.
34,m94ryl,367,2,I'd play that Mario bros. tbh
35,m94ryl,386,0,Lmao
36,m94ryl,401,1," Dude, can I just say that your comments have been super cool to read. Military strategy is not something I'm well versed in, so this has been a joy."
37,m94ryl,405,1,"of course, glad you enjoyed reading them"
38,lwpl71,5,15,Ah.. it's so evident how much these guys get of on the power of holding a gun. I'm sure they feel invincible.. They feel like they own the city..
39,lwpl71,6,25,Oh my God
40,lwpl71,22,4,Perfect example of why we have the 2nd Amendment and it’s importance...
41,lwpl71,30,4,"I'm a Burmese and I do want the US to come here.

Also, I'm one of the few people in the world who thinks what the US did in Korea was the right thing. We should feel lucky that we have a powerful but democratic nation like the US as world police. If you don't like that, imagine having no world police, or worse, having China or Russia as world police. You DON'T want that. Trust me."
42,lwpl71,36,3,I wish there were more I could do to help support protestors in Myanmar. I wish there I could easily contribute to there effort.
43,lwpl71,57,2,Goodluck to the Myanmar people. Praying for you.
44,lwpl71,77,1,2nd amendment looks real good right about now
45,lwpl71,80,0,Yeah I totally support U.S military intervention at this point.
46,lwpl71,85,1,Religion is working as intended
47,lwpl71,128,1,Thank god they had hard hats
48,lwpl71,146,1,"If it could happen there, it could happen here!"
49,lwpl71,150,1,"""WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS! ITS WHY WE GET TO ATTACK UNARMED PRISINORS! GET IT!?!?!?!"
50,lwpl71,163,1,U.S it is your time to shine and restore democracy! Oh wait... no oil? Never mind then
51,lwpl71,180,1,"Oh yeah. The famous American state that sows peace, freedom, and happiness all around the world."
52,lwpl71,210,3,100 percent correct. Period.
53,lwpl71,248,1,jokes on you its turkish so its completely safe
54,lwpl71,280,1,It's situations like this that proves the second amendment should be protected.
55,lwpl71,285,4," Hey thank you so much for wanting to help out. Obviously, donating is the best way to help (please let me know if you are able to donate and want to know how you can do that), but no worries if you can't. Sharing the news is another big way of helping the people and letting more people know about the reality of what's happening. This is especially helpful because for us Myanmar citizens, saying bad things about the military is considered high treason (basically what I'm doing right now), so some people are reluctant to speak up. Additionally, I would recommend following the following accounts on Instagram to keep up with the news: @ spotlight\_myanmar, @ worldwideburmesestudents, @ listenupmyanmar, @ humansofmm, and @ instamyanmar. The same goes for @ mrattkthu on Twitter. I recommend these accounts because they don't underreport the events, as opposed to the western media."
56,lwpl71,329,2,They're EMTs. Their job is to help the people.
57,lwpl71,343,1,Ok
58,lwpl71,355,10,Thank you for your reply. I'll do this!
59,lwpl71,358,1,"Ty for helping,our people need as much help as possible."
60,lwpl71,384,1,"Tbh 50k upvoted sounds kind of top

Not the top top but it's more than some other shit gets"
61,lwpl71,409,3,Thank you sir!
62,lwpl71,413,3,This is actually great. Founders of US must have been so genius. It gives some sort of power to the people to fight back or defend if indeed were faced with an evil police or armed forces.
63,lwpl71,416,2,Seems to be working out great in the middle east
64,lwpl71,421,1,Alright
65,lwpl71,445,1,"Yes, it sent some medicine to Burma and has shown support for Aung San Suu Kyi"
66,lwpl71,480,1,"They had a lotta neat ideas, yeah! Some stuff didn’t age so well, but a lot of it has aged (comparatively) pretty good, at least as far as the basics go."
67,lwpl71,500,1,"As a Chinese, I’m quite impressive to finally see some foreigners understand our policy of not intervening internal matters instead of constantly condemning China not doing anything"
68,lwpl71,515,1,Thanks for the added info.
69,lwpl71,528,6,The place with the king America likes
70,lwpl71,535,1,"I didn't see New Zealand before, damn my dyslexia. I'd vote for New Zealand. They seem alright. Albeit a tad snobbish."
71,lwpl71,543,1,Nice self portrait haha
72,lwpl71,545,1,"True. If the original Allied powers join forces to stop this, then there is a good chance we’ll be able to take back Myanmar from the communist government."
73,lwpl71,562,1,I’m more than willing to talk about this in person if you want.
74,lwpl71,565,2,Cool man. Sounds like a fun research project. Never once argued against American war crimes but glad you got that off of your chest
75,lwpl71,599,1,"Nah, just thought it would be nice to correct a naive child like you :)"

131,lwof70,6,5,I don't care anymore. This isn't something we can just let happen. We have a moral obligation to help. That is what America is supposed to be. This would be an excellent chance to show that side of US again.

235,lap93j,83,10,"This kind of stories and narrative need to come out more. The tales of ASSK trying to bridge Myanmar people including Rohingya. 

Take it from me, it took decades to gel everyone. In my country (Malaysia), we are still working on getting the racial harmony works with among us despite we gained independence from British in 1957. It take education and respect to get there and I applaud ASSK's efforts in getting there. God knows she is in difficult position to get it done but she tried.

Thanks for the kind and enlightening answer."
236,lap93j,86,4,"Thanks. I need to understand this. Thanks for giving me honest answer. Yes, I heard about the plan but I guess Rohingya people are just afraid of military reaction if they returned. 

It will take decades to mend the wound but with Myanmar people kindness, I believe it is possible."
237,lap93j,93,1,Well this is the good kind of oversimplifying
238,lap93j,100,17,"I've got great Muslim friends in Myanmar. Hell, I have had great Muslim tutors and teachers when I lived in Myanmar during my childhood. heck, the right-hand man of Aung San Suu Kyi who was a Muslim and was assassinated in broad daylight at the airport. And we all know who the culprit is. How come we never hear that news over here abroad??? He never got justice thanks to the military pulling strings. Sometimes it's best to not believe everything in the media. The political situation over there is complex and it would take ages for me to explain."
239,lap93j,120,1,"Excellent and much needed 'outburst' - I myself was also looking for answers. 

Generalization is a disease and  media try to do that furtively with some agenda.

Let's all stay human..."
240,lap93j,124,-4,Then use reason. That response was 1000 times better than the previous. I’m not after moral high ground I’m just pointing out what people are most likely to think. Getting the world on the side of the people of Myanmar is not about moral high ground (some of it can be though.) It’s mostly about facts.
241,lap93j,125,0,"That is a claim. That’s a good first step. However a claim with a source and or some other form of evidence is still more compelling. For the record I suspect the UN source is fragile at best, however the only argument against it that I have read have been unsubstantiated, or just emotional responses."
242,lap93j,127,2,"Hey dude I'm sorry I was so rude about Americans in my other comments. I was mostly saying that stuff to make a point to that guy. I actually think you guys are cool, for the most part."

253,lz10do,4,24,"Honest advice...tighten the shield wall, especially in the middle.  What made the Roman shield walls so effective was how tight they were.  Plus, overlap will help some areas be better protected against small arms fire.  Also, if you want I would suggest practicing moving as one whole unit.  That will give you protection whilst being mobile.  A chant or some form of rhythmic grunting/noise can help keep everyone in sync.  Moving a shield wall like that as one whole group will require that as a metronome of sorts. 

I'd love to hear from anyone with better experience on how you can outfit their shields against bullets and not weigh them down."

They've also had a better relationship with them than with Suu Kyi. The Tatmadaw are not CCP's lapdogs and India wants to keep it that way.

They lead to posts coming straight out of Myanmar. Use anything to get peoples attention. This picture would be a good one. It’s heartbreaking and moving and shows so much bravery.

616,mkliki,1,8,I know the OP through a mutual friend. He works at Tesla so I’m sure it’s legit.
617,mkliki,5,23,"I think Elon could easily help Myanmar but getting that equipment into the country is probably the biggest hurdle.  Military would just put a bullet through the antennae if they discovered one out there.

Starlink is definitely legit snd will change the world and the internet as we know it."
618,mkliki,8,15,This is awesome news if Musk is willing to help our country.

623,mkliki,31,2,Thank you for this comment!
624,mkliki,38,17,"Yes, I hope it is true and not some sick joke. It would be great if we got direct comfirmaton from Tesla."
625,mkliki,39,11,"Maybe, but his involvement, weather fruitful or not, will help spread awareness."
626,mkliki,40,15,"I'd venture to guess that if he can help, he will.  Starlink is new and this would be excellent advertising.  Helping would likely end up profitable."
627,mkliki,43,2,Our meme lord to the rescue!
628,mkliki,44,12,"Even if he won't help, he'll help because thanks to him Myanmar might make it to the headlines and some people may decide to support Burmese, for example by donating to the cause."

644,mn8wi9,64,2,Won't find me disagreeing with this point. I'm glad to see real progress in discussions about forming a federal army that includes ethnic armed groups.
645,mn8wi9,67,2,"I’m a fellow vet like you, just a pog though. I used my GI bill and have stayed in the region since I left the service. 

Thank you for all the support you are giving. I watched some of these kids grow up from teenagers to hopeful young adults who now have all placed their life on hold until they have a free future. I really, really thank you for supporting them.

If you ever get the opportunity, there is always room for an extra hand in any of the long term refugee camps on the Thai border."
646,mn8wi9,68,2,"It is my honor and pleasure to do my small part for the good of Myanmar. I have been following this since the beginning on february 1st and speaking out to any that will listen. I remember when I first found out I was outside the warehouse I work at smoking a cigarette waiting to start work when I saw the article pop up on my news feed. And at the warehouse a lot of my fellow coworkers are from Myanmar and I remember that day when the military overthrew the government quite a few of my coworkers had not shown up for work. I overheard my bosses being racist and  muttering ""all :those people' just called off and now we are shorthanded."" When we had our start of shift meeting when my manager asked if anyone had questions I stood out in front of everyone and told them what had just happened and that the company should not penalize or talk down about any of the workers who called off work because the country of Myanmar has been turned upside down and so most likely were probably too distraught to even get out of bed. A couple came up later and said they were suprised  that I knew and cared about their situation since I have no ties to Myanmar.   I replied that I simply just love all people and I despise evil.  Sorry for rambling lol."
647,mn8wi9,69,2,"No worries about the rambling, happy you got to talk about it.

That’s really cool what you did, I am sure it meant a lot to them. As you mentioned, they often say they feel quite invisible to the world. Also, fuck racism.

Please keep being that leader, in person and online. It is much needed in this word."

I am saying that the World needs more caring and noble person like him. He is working hard despite his earnings for the cause isn't much. 


If we have one hundred or even a couple of thousands of people like him, their efforts will pay off.

We are talking about hundreds if not  thousands of families and people being displaced from their homes and provinces as the war goes on. 

We are talking of buying weaponry and ammo which would cause millions of dollars.

We are talking about the possibility of a prolong war. 

Much much more money is needed to fund the effort."

I also want to note that proving to yourself and the world that you are not afraid of anything is a bad attitude, which can lead to trouble for you and your friends. It is okay to have fear. In fact, it is a rare anomaly when someone has no fear. When you control your fear, fear protects and helps you, fear as a friend advises when the risk is too great, but when fear controls you, it paralyzes you and the result may even kill you."
728,n0f7dj,2,3,The only successful slave revolt was the one that included women (Haiti)!

She gives hope by showing her bravery. That's all that matters."
730,n0f7dj,23,4,"To show the defiance despite ongoing savage oppression from Military Junta. Giving hope to the people who saw her brave gesture. 

If you have never lived under oppressed regime, I don't think you can understand our feeling."

732,n0f7dj,27,3,Bravery isn’t defined by just getting out and fight back with arms. It comes in several forms. Only if you knew. And only if you know how to appreciate it. One kind of bravery did not make another kind any lesser.

742,m886gv,35,2,"UN has had a number of meetings already. I do agree on raising awareness on ordinary citizens as politicians seemed to be all talk at this point. I know a friend of friend of mine’s 15 yr old American kid starting her small FB campaign raising funds and sending out free t-shirts she designed for Myanmar ppl, to donors on her expense to raise awareness. It’s emotionally motivating for Myanmar ppl just to see others care regardless of physical help."
743,m886gv,37,1,"It is amazing! Then she sends money to Mutual Aid Myanmar? Or is it used in some other way to raise awareness?
Yes, there are those who care, we just need to quickly find a way to join our ranks.
