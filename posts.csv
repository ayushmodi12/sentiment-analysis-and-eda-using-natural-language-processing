How you can help people of Myanmar in their fight for freedom if you are in another country?,m85p3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m85p3l/how_you_can_help_people_of_myanmar_in_their_fight/,1634,193,1616116079.0,myanmar,1.0,brocolliNcheese,17452,2554.0533333333333,"# What has happened and why?
On February 1 2021, the military in Myanmar, led by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing, staged a coup and successfully overthrown the democratically elected government. As a country that was under harsh military dictatorship for five decades from 1962 to 2011, the brutality and numerous crimes committed by the military including genocides and war crimes are apparent in its history. The infamous coup leader, Min Aung Hlaing, is well known for multitude of crimes from systemic discrimination and human rights violations against minority groups to ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya people for which he has received international condemnation and sanctions.

After the coup and the detainment of several officials that were democratically elected by civilians, citizens of Myanmar began peaceful protests through out the country and participated in Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM). However, the armed forces have ruthlessly treated peaceful protestors and CDM participants with live ammunitions, arsons, abductions and unthinkable torture methods that eventually lead to tragic deaths. As depressing as it is, it is worth giving some examples of the abomination carried out by the inhumane armed forces:

* a pregnant woman was shot point-blank in the head for helping peaceful protestors hide in her house
* a medical student was killed for trying to save injured people on a city street
* [an activist was abducted and tortured to death by pouring acid or extremely hot-liquid into his mouth and possible disembowelment](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/15/the-death-of-zaw-myat-lynn-allegations-torture-used-on-opposition-activist-in-myanmar)
* [grave of a 19-year old protestor who was shot dead was secretely dugged up by the police causing more outrage and raising concens of a cover up](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/12/asia/myanmar-protester-angel-democracy-martyr-intl-hnk/index.html)

Over 200 people have been killed at the time of writing this and thousands of civilians have been illegally detained. The fallen heroes who had given their lives fighting for freedom are but not limited to politicians, doctors, monks, pregnant women and children.

The atrocities of the military keep increasing day by day and these crimes of utmost savagery have to stop. Despite these circumstances, Myanmar people continue to stand for their rights and freedom. The sacrifice of the fallen heroes must not go in vain.

# How you can help and be part of this revolution:
* Civil servants and civilians have participated in strike sacrificing their jobs and incomes. Furthermore, due to the numerous arson attacks, vandalisms and other violent acts, some people have lost their houses or have to abandon to move to safer places. Please visit [Mutual Aid Myanmar](http://mutualaidmyanmar.org/) to help people of Myanmar by directly supporting the basic economic needs. You can also support by donating to the [fundraising by CRPH](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/crph), the parallel democratic government that is trying to overcome the military junta.
* If you are very keen on helping in this fight, you can organize peaceful protests where you live. Please check with your local authorities first before organizing one.
* It is also helpful to reach out to your representative or congressperson through letters, emails or phone calls to inform about your stance on the state of Myanmar and  your approval for sending any kind of help, be it a military aid, targeted sanctions or any other viable methods of support.
* You can also help by just raising awareness of the current situation in Myanmar. So, please spread the news to your friends, family and neighbours. Share it on social media platforms and make sure you include the following hashtags too:

Create Deep Fake videos of Junta leadership to create confusion and desertions among Myanmar Army soldiers and their supporters,m6phyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/myanmar/comments/m6phyq/create_deep_fake_videos_of_junta_leadership_to/,156,40,1615946691.0,myanmar,0.98,Droiddiddy,2492,3281.5500925925926,"I keep coming up with crazy ideas!  We, Burmese Myanmar people, are at war with the JUNTA so I will do what I must from the US while my countrymen are being killed!  

So, the Junta leadership, Tatmadaw (Myanmar military), and their mouthpiece news outlets lost all of their verified FB accounts and pages.  They cannot issue official statements or live stream their propaganda through FB. Facebook is the defacto form of communication in Myanmar.  It is our internet.  40% of Myanmar population has a fb account in 2020.  

What if DEEP Fake videos of Junta chairman Min Aung Hlaing or vice chair Soe Win or Junta SPOX Zaw Min Tun are made telling their soldiers to stand down or defect and join CDM?  Or make a deep fake a video of MRTV or MWD TV news announcer pointing out the Junta's atrocities and urge soldiers to desert?  Even make one of the previous JUNTA chief Gen Than Shwe (Min Aung Hlaing's old boss who is very old, alive and healthy) denouncing the coup?  Share these videos on facebook and tatmadaw supporters fb groups (some of which I shared on another thread for you all to report).  

This will cause massive confusion since DEEP FAKE is a new phenomenon.  JUNTA has no way to counter it on facebook w/o their bluecheck accts.  They have to rely on analogue radio and TV and paper newspaper to announce that these are fake videos.  But facebook has ability to view these videos on demand.   these videos will spread like wildfire on Burmese facebook.  

Gotta keep fighting!  #Fightback!
