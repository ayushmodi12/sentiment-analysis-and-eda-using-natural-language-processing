Aung San Suu Kyi the democratically elected leader of the country and daughter of one of their most revered revolutionaries.... has been arrested by the military who has taken power over the country in a coup! This has shaken me to the core to read!\\n\\nThis is particularly harrowing since it's happening AGAIN AFTER DECADES of brutal military dictatorship which was reversed in the last ten years to the point that even Obama went over there to congratulate the progress.... \\n\\nThis is horrifying on too many levels... Such a beautiful and incredible and wonderful country... With amazing people.... One of my most precious cultural travel experiences where I learned so so much and connected so deeply with the heritage there... Heartbreaking and I can barely articulate my utter shock at the situation...\\n\\nI only found out bc one of my blog posts is blowing up - so I googled Myanmar's current events.. otherwise I wouldn't have know this is going on! :/\\n\\nPlease let us know - how can we support? What can we do?\\n\\nEdit to add: What do you guys think of Biden proposing sanctions again? I fear this is only going to empower the military and hurt the people more...  \n",

Y'all need to seize their guns and use it against them. You can do it with the numbers. It won't be easy and most of you will die. But it will give the future of your children a chance. Without an uprising, the future will continue to be ruled by your leaders. And right now, they look worse than Chinese, North Korean and Islamic laws. I would give it a try if I had kids and my country was going through it. In fact, it is a duty to the human race to bring down tyrants. If you guys start small and fight smart, you have a much better chance. Plant the seeds of revolution so at least you could build a great army in the ling run. I worry for all you going through this. Good luck and please use your wits.\n",

I don't see a problem being the world police \\*IF\\* we actually do it to support the spread of freedom, peace, self-determination of the public, enforcing human rights (one of which is voting which is relevant here). IF those are the reasons we do things, that's grand, but you're correct that there is no evidence in our past actions that support that as a cause of our intervention. It has usually been greed. I will end by saying to be careful when you criticize American interventionism, and consider that we are not the only nation capable of engaging in it. Look just how rough things have gotten with the Uyghurs/HKong and again with the Crimea when these States smell blood in the water. tl;dr anti-interventionists be careful what you wish for.\n",

Also use gasoline instead and for added stickiness and longer burn break up Styrofoam in the gasoline or 50/50 gas + used motor oil but the Styrofoam is much more superior. it will instantly dissolve and create a thick hot burning inextinguishable gel that is akin to napalm or Greek fire. burns on water floats as well. Not to advocate going this far but you are now defending yourselfs. if you have pressure cookers there are many ways you can make them go boom with household chemicals. Fill them with rocks glass nuts and bolts; when the military lines are pushing start them in between your lines then hastily retreat and allow them to be over them if you cant get them close to place them (you can obviously use carts to push them down street). I would never normally advocate this for protest but if you are defending your life you must do any and everything to protect it at all costs. if you are dying its time to be more creative and effective then roman candles and dennis the menace sling shots. you are dying ffs.\n",

Go back to previous posts and tell me exactly how a slingshot is better than a sling. Why did David slay goliath with a sling and not a slingshot? Why did ancient armies use slings and not slingshots. The only time armies used sling shot in past is a ballista and that was minimum 2 man crew served weapon.

      "\n",
      "I need to be fast, so I’m going to bullet point this (pun not intended):\n",
      "\n",
      "1) If you really believe (and if there’s evidence to support) that the military is going to start bombing their hundreds of their own countrymen in order to maybe perhaps kill a single protester, then that’s another argument for allowing anyone willing to take up arms.  The military is already escalating against a people that are wholly defenseless.  I’ve seen people telling them to rig up slingshots with rubber gloves and soda bottles and sticks and string to fight back because they’re so desperate.  Holding out hope that evil men will show the defenseless people they’re murdering a bit of good will out of the blue is a fool’s errand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Canada’s sanctions on China have no bearing on what’s going on in Myanmar unless you know something I don’t.  I’d love it if you could find me one local that’s praising God that Canada is imposing economic sanctions after finding out their loved ones were murdered, because that would at least show they’re somewhat hopeful during a seemingly hopeless situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) To reiterate:  Sure, fighting back will lead to harm, but doing nothing is already leading to harm.  At least if the willing are capable of fighting back, the military will slow their roll and rethink their strategy.  Even evil men want to live to see another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) People being defenseless doesn’t mean less violent crime.  Fewer guns means less gun-related deaths and injuries, but it also means the weakest among us are less capable from defending themselves against motivated criminals.  Once you account for crimes in a small handful of densely populated US cities, general violent crime rates plummet substantially.  What’s most notable, though, is that even by the Brady Campaign’s stats (one of the most fervent anti-gun lobby groups in the US), people successfully defend themselves with firearms over 6.5x more often than people are killed in gun-related homicides every year.  Even when you throw in all gun-related deaths — homicides, suicides, accidents, and negligent discharges — the number of successful defense scenarios is still more than 2.5x higher annually.

      "\n",
      "2. Prices - Americans by in large despite disliking China aren't prepared or willing to pay higher prices for everyday goods. As proven with the mask shortage during the early days of the pandemic, America is as incapable sometimes as producing goods adequately in a service-based economy as some of our citizens would be to afford the higher prices.\n",

      "3) Historical context - China's push to modernize is a complex and moving situation, but it began as an idea that they would redeem themselves for the century of shame by around 2050 (100 years after the founding of the PRC). So if we remove their economic means, they might transition toward a more violent approach. So this strategy could potentially accelerate a WW3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Foreign powers - American trade policy with regard to China is one thing, but other nations, even allied nations may not be nearly as willing to endure similar economic hardship for the sake of weakening China and other states may fill the gap that we leave behind.\n",

Rwanda, Cambodia, Germany, and many more.  Politically I don't see the US or China influencing what happens in Myanmar that much. [Sanctions won't be effective here](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/04/what-america-should-and-shouldnt-do-about-myanmars-coup/) but it'll be one of the only things the US has to do to look good. China's not necessarily a buddy for them because who wants to be a pawn? I think we'll see a North Korea situation here (lots of talk, civilians suffering, but nothing big happens) but you never know.\n",

      "Comment: you can’t keep them separate though because the us military uses them in tandem, every squad of infantry on the ground has a air controller with them to direct air strikes on anything that points a gun at them. i understand your meaning, and your reasoning on your conclusion, but the two have to be considered together. China has all of about a dozen modern stealth fighters for air superiority, and they are very prone to mechanical issues. the United States has hundreds to thousands of modern stealth fighters, more than enough for complete air superiority over both a tactical and strategic air zone. with that air superiority they have free rain to rain hell on the chinese ground forces as our own ground forces advance on their position.

Also geopolitical references should be kept to the last 30 years for strategic relevance. The game has changed a lot since the true dawn of the internet age. I'm gonna put a pin in this because it deserves it's own thread. But I think you have a...warped view on the concept of national sovereignty.

If you want an insurgency, civilians with weapons before the war is not a needed pre requisite. Because by the time your country melted into a war zone weapons are already everywhere be it supplied from foreign sources or released from armoury or government depo.\n",

The US already had local bases in Asia and the pacific to maintain the early slog and make them pay with a huge technology/ air and naval power advantage. Invading China would also be impossible.

Myanmar, North Korea, Taiwan, and India are the most likely battlefields we are looking at for our future conflicts. I personally don’t know how it would go for China, would the North Koreans fight with them and invade South Korea? the war with China will almost certainly start over Taiwan imho, which potentially means Japan and South Korea getting involved as well. Chinese expansionism is currently running unchecked and our key allies in the Asian-Pacific are in their sights. we need a strong president right now who realizes that China is our enemy, who takes a hardline against China for the sake of our allies and our nation. Is Biden that president? absolutely not. was Trump? kinda. for the sake of our future and the future of every one of our asian allies, we need to turn our eyes against china. lest taiwan become another hong kong.\n",

It's not ideal, but it's better for the people of Myanmar, several of whom I've spoken with personally using online translators ,and they are okay with US military intervention. So I think \"nobody gives a shit about human rights\" is an extremely cynical worldview and a dangerous point to cede. We should try to live up to our agreements.

Sharing the news is another big way of helping the people and letting more people know about the reality of what's happening. This is especially helpful because for us Myanmar citizens, saying bad things about the military is considered high treason (basically what I'm doing right now), so some people are reluctant to speak up. Additionally, I would recommend following the following accounts on Instagram to keep up with the news: @ spotlight\\_myanmar, @ worldwideburmesestudents, @ listenupmyanmar, @ humansofmm, and @ instamyanmar. The same goes for @ mrattkthu on Twitter. I recommend these accounts because they don't underreport the events, as opposed to the western media.\n",

He said pretty much the west has sanctioned Myanmar for a long time over the military regime, so instead they are taking bad deals with China who hasn't sanctioned them. They are becoming more and more reliant, taking out bad deals cuz that's all they can get. I know it was only one sentence of your comment though I feel even western sanctions cannot do much cuz we have sanctioned them for a long time now and they doubled down and rely on china instead\n",

      "Comment: From my understanding and research, a military coup took place to out the democratic group that was elected in by the people. From what I heard, the reasoning was that there was election fraud, but others say its a power grab. Either way, the citizens are rightfully pissed and protesting heavily because apparently, the people gained a lot of freedom after the election. I'd say, if what I've read is true, the police and military committing murder and assault in the streets know they have their comrades next to them and their military behind them so they feel comfortable taking out their transgressions on the protesters. Either that or they're eyes deep in propaganda to the point they think the protesters are something else. This is just my speculation however, as I'm from the US and can only go off what I've been reading. If any locals from the country in question know better, correct me.\n",

You can go all the way back to the trail or tears, where they would say the natives could stay on their land while the US develops. However, the bigger the US was getting, the more the people and the government was considering moving them West. This goes along with any other tribe. They were promised riches and land, but always given the worst. I’m not mad though because when they moved a lot of these natives to reservations, their land was put upon what was considered the “worst” land just because it was hard to be able to grown.. but now this age, native land has a lot of non renewable resources and the government is trying to take that away from the people again. It’s a still struggle on reservations though. You see; the US didn’t care about Natives, they just wanted the land. It also goes to show you that even with the land they’re on now, they’re still wanting to take it away for their profits.\n",

      "*People with guns*. I'm not sure why gun nuts think this is an effective argument. Nobody has ever suggested that guns kill people without being fired by humans. It really doesn't change the argument at all. Access to guns, and their relative speed and ease of use when it comes to killing people, results in thousands more murders. It also drives the suicide rate, and is why we have so many cases of parents killing their own kids. People are way, way more likely to kill with a gun than they are with a knife or any other weapon, and for good reason. Guns offer a quick, clean and easy way to kill. Most people are too squeamish to start hacking at human flesh with a knife. You have to be right on your victim, right up close to the blood and the guts, with your victim fighting back. Guns give people the option of killing from a distance, without having to deal with the gore and the tearing of flesh and the fighting back. Having a gun in the drawer gives people going through moments of flashpoint rage a quick and convenient method to act on that rage in a deadly fashion, where that rage would have passed without murder had there been no gun available. Also established fact: gun owners are more likely to die by gunfire than non gun owners, and their kids are more likely to be murdered. Guns are *very much* the issue here, and I very much *do* know what I'm talking about. \n",

      "Comment: Developed countries are synonymous with high income countries. You know exactly what I'm comparing America to. Countries in a similar range of development. South Africa is considered to be *developing.* It has aspects that are very developed, but large aspects which are not considered developed. You're listing a whole bunch of countries which are considered to be *developing*, not developed. The developed countries are high income. The *Western World* is generally considered to be North America, Europe and Australasia. Anyway, none of this matters, because no matter if we consider a comparison to the Western World, \"developed countries\" or \"high income countries,\" the result is the same. The US has the highest murder rate. By far. \n",

      "No, it's certainly not true that \"nearly all\" of the violence takes place in a few select cities. In fact, *half* the violence happens in 127 cities, including the larger ones. The fact that they have stringent gun laws is irrelevant - the fact is that *all* of these illegal guns started life as legal guns, and were only manufactured because there is a huge market for them in a country awash in gun culture. All of the guns found in cities like NYC and Chicago were either bought in states with lax gun laws or they were stolen from irresponsible legal gun owners who didn't secure them adequately. They were then transported across state lines and sold in predominantly low income inner city areas, where they drive the murder rate. Besides which, Dallas has widespread legal gun ownership and its per capita murder rate is consistently four times that of NYC according to FBI figures. \n",

      "Le 1er février 2021, les militaires du Myanmar, dirigés par le commandant en chef Min Aung Hlaing, ont organisé un coup d'État et renversé avec succès le gouvernement démocratiquement élu. Le Myanmar a été soumis à une dictature militaire sévère pendant cinq décennies, de 1962 à 2011. La brutalité et les nombreux crimes commis par les militaires, notamment des génocides et des crimes de guerre, sont évidents dans son histoire. Le tristement célèbre chef du coup d'État, Min Aung Hlaing, est connu pour une multitude de crimes allant de la discrimination systémique et des violations des droits de l'homme à l'encontre des groupes minoritaires au nettoyage ethnique contre le peuple Rohingya, pour lesquels il a fait l'objet d'une condamnation et de sanctions internationales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Après le coup d'État et la détention de plusieurs responsables démocratiquement élus par la population civile, les citoyens du Myanmar ont commencé à manifester pacifiquement dans tout le pays et ont participé au Mouvement de désobéissance civile (CDM). Cependant, les forces armées ont impitoyablement traité les manifestants pacifiques et les participants au CDM à l'aide de balles réelles, d'incendies criminels, d'enlèvements et de méthodes de torture impensables qui ont fini par entraîner des morts tragiques. Aussi déprimant que cela puisse être, il convient de donner quelques exemples de l'abomination perpétrée par les forces armées inhumaines :\n",
      "\n",
      "• Une femme enceinte a été abattue d'une balle à bout portant dans la tête pour avoir aidé des manifestants pacifiques à se cacher dans sa maison\n",

      "• Un étudiant en médecine a été tué pour avoir tenté de sauver des blessés dans une rue de la ville\n",
      "\n",
      "• Un militant a été enlevé et torturé à mort en lui versant de l'acide ou un liquide extrêmement chaud dans la bouche et en l'éventrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "• La police a secrètement déterré la tombe d'un manifestant de 19 ans tué par balle, ce qui a provoqué une nouvelle vague d'indignation et suscité des soupçons de dissimulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus de 200 personnes ont été tuées au moment où nous écrivons ces lignes et des milliers de civils ont été détenus illégalement. Les héros qui ont donné leur vie en luttant pour la liberté sont, entre autres, des hommes politiques, des médecins, des moines, des femmes enceintes et des enfants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les atrocités commises par les militaires augmentent de jour en jour et ces crimes d'une sauvagerie extrême doivent cesser. Malgré ces circonstances, le peuple du Myanmar continue de défendre ses droits et sa liberté. Le sacrifice des héros tombés au combat ne doit pas être vain.\n",

The support level for the coup is so low that only people who are opportunistic and same flocks will openly join them. But the more worrying fact is there are many of those who would join them if the junta were to behave a little better. They were using the mass psychology to show their worst and people will accept if the situation is a little bit better. But don’t forget they do not give in or relax anything since they control the country administrative power.

Remember all these ethnic cleansing was normalized thanks to the Buddhist extremists and all the people who blindly followed their propaganda with the help of Facebook. It sounds wrong but the peaceful protests gets you no where, what will that accomplish? If you want to overthrow then petition for USA to help you because they got the biggest military budget in the world. Just don’t go Isis on them (Hillary and company supported the rebellion, and that rebellion later became Isis). If not the USA then I guess ask China but honestly your asking for another wave of “re-education” and forced assimilation to accept their ideology or else you will be sent to camps, whereas USA will just end up outsourcing company factories to Myanmar for cheaper wage and more efficient product manufacturing. A lot of countries in the sub Asian part were better off under the rule of others because they proved time and time again they can’t take care of themselves and end up creating more tragedies for their own people.\n",

      "Comment: .Let me give you a quick recap of our country's history. The military had control over the country for nearly 30 years in the past, (started off by killing most important generals, straight up gunning down protestors including a couple thousands of students and monks, creating corruption beyond measure, and selling away all the country resources for their own good, letting ppl starve under a dictatorship ).  But since the democratic party won the election in 2015 with a landslide victory, they lost their previous authority/ways get corrupted money. The last 5 years has been quite stable in the country except for the Rohingya crisis that was also carried out by the same murderers from the military. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi went out there at the ICJ for the face and name of the fellow Burmese citizens,(didn't have the power to do anything other than that). Fast forward to the coup happening... 2020 elections saw the most votes for the democratic party in history. Just as the citizens were hoping of erasing their bs laws they had set out during their rule, the military seized all the members who are in charge right in the middle of a parliament meeting. (reasoning that there was fraud in the votes and they had to do the right thing!!) They also staged instability/protests in the country to find a proper reason for an emergency takeover. (also cutting off all networks and phone lines). Most of the democratic leaders and political speakers are now detained and sent to jail for really absurd reasons like( owning a walkie-talkie: how Daw Su was framed, breaking covid safety rules: how our president was framed, and sometimes for no reason). Now they are threatening us with the weapons that we; civilians bought through taxes. The military has a good relationship with China and is ready to illegally sell all of the country's resources once again to get all the money they can for themselves. Now, this may sound highly biased but all of them are certainly true- you can ask Burmese ppl, I doubt that it would be any different.\n",

      "Comment: Basically our long time military oppressors (the same one who massacred the Rohingyas) led a coup staging \"election fraud\" against our democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the NLD. There is no proof of election fraud and the lies keep switching up. The leaders and the party we voted for has been arrested (on some BS charge like owning walky talkies) and disbanded (kinda). The military stated that there was a state of emergency, which allows them to take over a year, which is stated in the constitution that they wrote. They say they will hold \"free and fair\" elections during the year, but history has shown us that these dogs aren't to be trusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now, we're on the streets to free our leaders and rewrite the constitution, which will lead to a more fair democracy with a more fair ground for ethnic minorities (Rohingyas, Karens and so on). Every night from 8 PM to 4 AM, we have a curfew and they'll shoot us if we're more than 5 during these times. The internet is shut off from 1AM to 9PM. During the nights, they've been arresting activists, students, lawyers, doctors and more. \n",

      "\n",
      "As for why Military did those, it is for 2 reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Military hates Rohingya people and they want to scare them so they run away completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) They want to cause politic instability in Myanmar and tarnish ASSK's reputation in the international community.\n",

      "However, the entirety of Myanmar have neutral, dislike, and hate relationship with Rohingya people. To understand that, you need to know there are 4 categories of Rohingya people.\n",
      "\n",
      "1st category - descendants of Muslim merchants from 1000 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd category - descendants of working slaves for railway projects during the British colonial era. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "4th category - illegal immigrants from Bengladesh through porous borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, among them. We are very fine with the 1st category and they are even an elite class in our country. They are rich and influential.\n",

      "\n",
      "About the 3rd category, we pitied them at that time but it was supposed to be temporary which became permanent because India conveniently forgot about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the 4th category, we hate them with passion because they commit gangrapes and serial killings in broad daylight. About 10 years ago in Rakhine state, before all these clearance operations started, do you know the happenings in there? We have serial murder and rape cases in Rakhine state almost every day because Rohingya population of certain areas outnumber Rakhine population by 1 to 10. Without Mabatha's or Military's interventions, Rakhine ethnics would have been completely annihilated by now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mabatha and Military are allies and we dislike both. But they have different goals. Mabatha for instance does not rape. They just kill and look down on rohingya as ugly monsters who threaten peace. They are headed by Extremist Monk Wirathu. However, they are compassionate towards Rakhine ethnics. Military on the other hand just seeks constant benefits. They save Rakhine ethnics to get popularity support. In fact, the Military also rapes and murders Rakhine ethnics so the main victims here are Rakhine ethnics, not just Rohingya people alone. They are the weakest force here.\n",

      "What happens now...\n",
      "\n",
      "It is simple. Constitution grants 25% automatic congress seats to Military and you need 75% to change constitution. Military lost all the non-automatic seats so they are afraid of Civilian Government changing the constitution so they took action first by arresting the State Counsellor, the President and all the Congressmen. However, we have two Vice Presidents - one is installed by the Military and the other by Civilian Government.\n",
      "\n",
      "President was held at gun point and asked to sign the State of Emergency. He rejected, saying they can kill him if they want but he won't sign. So, the Military's Vice President now became Acting President and he issued State of Emergency in the former's place (which is semi-legal) that grants Full Power to Military.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for ASSK, Military hijacked her account and posted a message that tells every citizen to rise up in arms. Military arrested her under the clause \"Causing Civil Unrest\".\n",
      "\n",
      "All the Congressmen are also arrested. I think they will be pressured to change the constitution for 50% automatic congress seats for Military.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the international community, we don't expect much from them. They didn't help us ten years ago and they won't help us this time. As for the reasons, a few weeks ago China's Foreign Minister visited Myanmar. He talked with Military and will use Veto in United Nations to prevent foreign intervention. As for sanctions, they will only hurt the civilians and not Military. For example, if United States bans Myanmar's exports, the civilians will be helpless and unable to do anything. But Military will export them to Thailand, India, China, and perhaps even Russia. So the sanctions hold no effects except destabilising the country further.\n",

      "> 93. The constitutional powers of the civilian authorities afford little scope for controlling the actions of the Tatmadaw, nor is there any indication that they participated directly in planning or implementing security operations or were part of the command structure. Nevertheless, nothing indicates that the civilian authorities used their limited powers to influence the situation in Rakhine State where crimes were being perpetrated. The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events, or seek alternative avenues to meet a responsibility to protect the civilian population. On the contrary, the civilian authorities have spread false narratives, denied the wrongdoing of the Tatmadaw, blocked independent investigations (including that of the fact-finding mission), and overseen the destruction of evidence. Through their acts and omissions, the civilian authorities have contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes. \n",

      "Myanmar should be a lesson for Chinese citizens. Prosperity without freedom, you risk to lose everything. Under the democratic government, although with very little power they had, Myanmar was moving towards prosperity. Once the guy at the top went and made a crazy move, the country turns into a failed state. It's not because of the Junta leader that Myanmar fails, it's the system. The bad system of allowing a dictator to have too much power. Allowing a dictator to control and command everything. So long as you have good dictators who make right decisions, things will be OK. But, once a bad one is in charge, people lose everything. That's because the system is set up that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's even more worrying for China. If president Xi decides to wage war with the west and invades Taiwan, a lot of people could die. It's just his ambition and the legacy that he wants to leave as a guy who unites China but it will be at the expense of the prosperity and safety of Chinese people. Correct me if I am wrong, currently Chinese citizens, even for a little, cannot criticize the CCP or PLA or even the police -- essentially people have no power against their government. Look at Jack Ma, relatively powerful man with huge wealth, CCP can take it away from him overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, Myanmar citizens know that what CCP says in front of the world and the media is not what they do. There is no transparency. They say no intervention but both Russia and China are selling weapons to the Myanmar fascist military without any care for the ordinary citizen.\n",

      "Comment: I definitely understand what you're saying. The very unfortunate fact of the matter is that the conduct that is occurring, does not appear to fit within the scope of any legal justification that would obligate China to agree with the remainder of the UN. I just read through \"Universal Jurisdiction,\" which is only relevant and applicable to hold individuals accountable to stand trial as accused (not military intervention), and from what I can tell, in order for Universal Jurisdiction to apply, it would need to be filed by a State — a country willing to do so, which the US has never done — and must also be investigated within the State in which the alleged offenses took place. That means the junta would have to be willing to open an investigation into its own conduct, which it has the local jurisdictional the right to refuse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Police action, or enforcement action, most commonly known by modern standards as counter-insurgency, is only applicable when an \"insurgency\" can be established. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"When insurgency is used to describe a movement's unlawfulness by virtue of not being authorized by or in accordance with the law of the land, its use is neutral. However, when it is used by a state or another authority under threat, ‘insurgency‘ often also carries an implication that the rebels' cause is illegitimate, whereas those rising up will see the authority of the state as being illegitimate.\" (F. Weigand, 2017, afghan's taliban — legitimate jihadists or coercive extremists? From the Journal of Intervention and Statebuilding) which makes it sound like it not apply due to the junta's claim of election fraud and its declaration to hold new elections in one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of China blocking action by the UN, they're doing so based on: 1) the claim that it is an \"internal matter\" and a \"cabinet reshuffle\" and 2) speculative, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \"And the largest foreign player in Myanmar's economy, China, will be all too happy to recalibrate its engagement to recognize the new facts on the ground\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's probably safe to assume that the Chinese government is resistant to an even greater presence of the US in Asia. Historically, any time the US military sets foot in a country, they begin to establish a military bases in that country. There are currently over 800 military bases in foreign countries all across the world, with hundreds of thousands of troops deployed throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way I interpret all of this tells me that, until China comes on board with the rest of the UN, there are no legal grounds for military intervention without a declaration of war or a straight up invasion, which would likely set the stage for, at minimum, a conflict between whichever invading country is present, Myanmar's junta, and China, since it would be their UN opposition that was ignored. In that event, it would likely set the stage for WW3. At this point it appears as though the only thing can be done is unilateral sanctions by individual countries, but from what I've read, more invested countries in the area, such as vietnam and Japan, are unlikely to impose unilateral sanctions because of their vested interests within Myanmar. Whereas the US does not have much of a vested interest or presence at all, sanctions imposed by the US will have little impact. Furthermore, unilateral sanctions are more likely to negatively impact the civilian population rather than the junta. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, in essence, you are entirely correct that humanitarian rights/law is actively being violated, the perpetrators of such can be subjected to universal jurisdiction under the Geneva Conventions, namely under Article 3. But, as you said in your first statement that you feel as though China is blocking protection of the civilian population, your feeling would appear to be entirely accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all I've read up to this point, until an armed group large enough to pose a threat to the junta and can be considered an \"insurgency\", it doesn't look like China has any real obligation to backpedal on its current standpoint to allow a counter-insurgency. Even if an insurgency were to be established, which side China would take is anybody's guess.\n",

      "Comment: Burma is geo politically very important for China. This is a known facts that everyone who are familiar with international politics and global affair. There are many ways China involved in Myanmar politics obvious one is supporting armed ethnic groups for insurgencies. Democratic and peaceful multi interests independent Myanmar will make a difficult field for China to compete with the west, Japanese and the OIC countries. In that scenario, China will not get special favor like while dealing with the illegitimate regime. I have a lot of optimism on China based on what our leader mentioned before she was detained. She said China is truly a good friend and a good neighbor to Myanmar. I was expecting China to send clear message to the inhumane behaviors of the junta will not be tolerated in today’s world. But when China issue statement to protect its business (merely 5 garment factories) while ignoring the loss of hundred of lives, I have to lower my expectations on China to be a moral leader to save our declining humanity. It is time for China to reconsider its foreign policy to be more human oriented than its own interest protected. If China wants to be in leading role in the world, now is the best time to show its good will. I believe for the very reason central Asian and African nations are not very happy with self-centered Chinese investments around the world. \n",

      "I was referring to flanking and APC faced by the protestors and shield in general military use. Military probably can use a true bullet resistant shield in niche situations like gunshields on mounted MGs on vehicles or a smaller shield attached to a rifle or MG that allows the user to be more protected when firing aimed shots over covers or from a prone position. Currently, without such protection, troops pinned down by automatic fire can only return aimed fire while exposing their face, throat, and head. Often, they are suppressed if the fire is accurate. With a shield attached to a rifle or MG that exposes only a small slit for sights, sufficiently motived troops can actually fire back somewhat. FOV is bad, but a properly setup defensive position will have narrow fields of fire for each man anyway.\n",

      "Comment: For no reason is not an objective statement whatsoever. You are saying that a commander one day ordered to blast the village for “no reason”? They pull out the plane from hanger, arranged the bombs, fueled the plane, and go out in the wild ride and decided to a bomb random village for ”no reason”? Why does the strike happens just now and not in the past or future? Why this place out of many other places to conduct a strike? There are many questions left to answer and it is definitely not a “no reason”. And unlike other massacres and crimes they have committed before, this doesn’t work like this because in order for an airstrike to happen, you need multiple chains of command to order such decisions whereas the usual gun/on-ground crimes can be committed by any privates in the army. Still if they are just innocent civilians, then i feel very sorry for them. It could have been an misjudgment of the striking location as well.\n",

Also, when the people asking for our help realize that we're only there to piss off the Russians or the Chinese, and don't really care about them or their country or their cause. That's always fun.\n",

When an unelected dictator who won't even let the people of his country vote can vote himself on the Security Council for the UN not to intervene in crimes against humanity and atrocities that he himself via his Tatmadaw lapdogs  are responsible for.

Also she was disqualified from being Prime Minister at the elections because Tatmadaw past a law that it was illegal because she had a foreign husband. So she was through a loophole instated in to the government as a state councillor not PM. A government where you had to gain a 75% majority to pass a motion and the Tatmadaw Junta comprised of 75% . She made a deal with the devil and indeed was very naive. If she had said anything that compromised the junta regarding the Rohingya she would if been back in prison long before February. So indeed many people believe she supported the genocide. Personally I don't believe this is the case despite what she said to UN reps and stuff that was reported in TV and other media outlets. She also could not support Muslims at this time because of the Buddhist Nationalism which in Myanmar is very strong even amoungst her supporters and could not be seen to support Muslims if she wanted to win the election\n",

I suspected CCP would do anything to stop a Myanmar democracy on there door step. Thanks for the further insight, I'll have to study more on this topic but that's a few more pieces in the puzzle. It's all a bit confusing. I know that CCP have the big BRI and India also are doing something up the coast and that PLA recently supplied arms to the Arakun militia in return for protecting CCP interests in Rankine via PLA fishing boats on a Bangladesh beach and CCP are doing what ever they can to delay Indian projects in the area. As with most wars the more I learn the more complex it becomes. I can't imagine what will happen if these dozens and dozens of militias actually win against the Tatmada.

I also suspect the inappropriate response by the international community to the  Rohingya situation where over 24,000 were killed in retaliation for the deaths of about a dozen Tatmada also may have empowered them. Where as this time they've killed 500 and the international response has been much harsher with the USA for example cutting all ties. I think this is because of all the footage coming out of Myanmar the last 2 months is so graphic and there wasn't alot of images of the atrocities in Rankine state. With all the images being beamed around the world this time has certainly led many more people to put pressure on their governments across the globe to take stronger action.\n",

      "Today it's obvious that CCP want to stay on good terms with militias in Shan state where they have many business interests, built airports and is a major BRI corridor. PLA supply weapons in return to protect it's interests. As they are doing with the Arakun in Rakhine to protect PLA defacto naval base being developed.

      "I'm guessing that CCP want everyone in Myanmar to fight each other while they make $$$billions selling ammo to all sides. Once every side is destroyed or on its knees PLA will move in under the guise of UN peacekeepers and get the threat of democracy and western influence away from Chinas doorstep. It's concerning that CCP have recently passed the Military Civilian Fusion Law and given PLA the mandate to protect CCP interests overseas just in the last few months.\n",

The Chinese goverment itself, expressed their anger towards the burning of chinese factories, the protestors that they are adressing were the anti chinese ones. Like the ones in the photo who care more about china than the military coup wich are the real problem. When protestors in myanmar spend more time and energy attacking china, the military spends their time celebrating for they arent oposing the coup, just anotger goverment that has nothing to do it...\n",

Make them feel like there are no consequences for trying. So, if at first you don't succeed, try, and try again! It's stupid. The constitution they like to hold up says to literally execute people for doing that. I'm not saying we should go that far. But, there needs to be some punishment to deter it next time. I say next time, because there's no doubt in my mind it will happen again. They stormed congress with Trump, their messiah, in the white house. Imagine what they will do now Biden is in. They're not going to hold back, and people are going to die unnecessarily because democrats are spineless twits. They literally tried to overthrow the government and you didn't do anything!

I don't agree with the \"Military intervention is always bad\" scenario. We'd all be goosestepping if that was the prevalent attitude throughout the 1930s (It was, but the world got off its ass at some point). War has already come from the inside, it is just a one sided beatdown with no end in sight, we've already lived under this system in Burma for the past many decades. It is just clear that the majority of the people do not want this rule, our elected government do not want this rule.. and by its own foundations, the UN is supposed to intervene.. but ofc the UN and frankly the west's rhetoric of sanctions and strongly worded letters combined with their outrage is just a smokescreen for their inaction. Intervention will not happen most likely, as that would require ethical people in power. The world's inaction just shows that we are all ruled by the same cockroaches, they are just more honest about their BS here.\n",

      "THE PRESIDENT:  We must speak up for human rights.  It’s who we are.  We can’t — my comment to him was — and I know him well, and he knows me well.  We’re — a two-hour conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "MR. COOPER:  You talked about this to him?\n",

      "THE PRESIDENT:  I talked about this, too.  And that’s not so much refugee, but I talked about — I said — look, you know, Chinese leaders — if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been — the time when China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home.  So the central — to vastly overstate it — the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China.  And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I point out to him: No American President can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States.  And so the idea I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China and Taiwan, trying to end the One China policy by making it forceful — I said — and by the — he said he — he gets it.  Culturally, there are different norms that each country and they — their leaders — are expected to follow.    \n",

      "\n",
      "But my point was that when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president — that’s how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu — not a joke — his predecessor, President Hu — and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another because he was going to be the president.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there will be repercussions for China, and he knows that.  What I’m doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other — other agencies that have an impact on their attitude.\n",

My grandfather had a business disagreement with an old work partner many years ago and the guy put a judgement on him for 1.5M. My grandpa never talked to the guy again, continued doing what he did everyday and still does. He’s bought plenty of houses and cars and whatnot since and does pretty well for himself, and he’s never once paid a penny of it, nor has anyone tried to make him. A fine is worthless if the person can’t or won’t pay it. Just like a law is useless if people won’t follow it. The simple fact is that when you tell someone “you can’t own that!”, or “you can’t do that!”, it just makes them want it more. Gun control is an absolute joke, just like the war on drugs. And btw, the Myanmar government announced that they had completed confiscating just about all guns in the country not long at all before this coup started, because they knew they couldn’t victimize an armed population nearly as easy.

The idea that “well they have planes and tanks so guns wouldn’t help” just shows you have absolutely zero understanding of how an actual war works and the logistics of it.  The government can’t place a tank and plane and jet plane on every corner and every street and as an escort to every truck carrying vital supplies to the entire military.  An armed population is a more free population.\n",

      "Comment: There's a fundamental misunderstanding that the idea behind an armed citizenry is maintained for the purpose of winning a war against the military. The idea is that it prevents the government from doing whatever they want. It makes them realize that they either stop trampling on rights, or they mobilize for all-out war. At this point, the individuals in the military are left with the decision of who they will fight for, their family and communities, or the government of whom they understand their role as a low-paid tool (if the government generally strives for good, this is called service and can be quite admirable, if the government is looking to slaughter their family, this is called being a stooge). Then the government starts a logistical nightmare campaign against it's own guerilla citizens, opening themselves to a PR disaster and allowing their allies to reconsider their alliance. After a long and protracted campaign, none of the traditional spoils of war are available - the economy is a shallow husk of what it once was, the citizenry will never trust them again, nor mobilize in effort toward re-industrialization...as citizens have time to organize, the possibility of a coup arises....... and the list of projected outcomes continues to get bleaker and bleaker.\n",

An open war between an established, experienced military and an untrained “guerilla” force would result in massive one sided casualties. I’ve seen it with my own eyes they’ve been at it since the end of WW2. How do u expect the civilians to get guns by the way? You’re an armchair Warhawk who actually has no clue about how a war works if you’d been to war you probably wouldn’t be for it. I’m sure the only reason you care about all this now is that this whole ordeal is being televised. Go read up on the history of this conflict. I’m not saying they need to kneel to the army but maybe they could ramp up acts of civil disobedience, disrupting supply lines, looking to outside alliances, sanctions, general strikes and countless other ways before entering into an actual war. They’d lose and they’d lose so bad that I doubt they’d ever recover.\n",

Don't think about the hell economy and inflation too hard, it's a way for grieving family to provide for their loved ones and keep their memory alive. \n",

      "Comment: Glad that you ask. It is a long story. I assume you are Chinese so I will explain Parallel to Qing Dynasty and the start of the century of humiliation. China has like the Chinese Chamber of commerce in Myanmar. It is the same as What the British did in HK and the century of humiliation. That Chamber of commerce as a  first-class citizen in Myanmar while we citizen of Myanmar are treated third or second class in our own country. They collude with the Myanmar military which is like the Qing dynasty who didn't dare to industrialize China because they will need to educate and empower the mass han population and it will be the end of their dynasty. So is the Myanmar Military, they didn't dare to educate or give democracy in Myanmar or it will be the end of military dictatorship. btw, Myanmar Junta hired an Israeli lobbyist with 2 million dollars. The money came from the Chinese Chamber of commerce account when it was traced. This group did all sorts of things to prop up Dictatorship in Myanmar in return. The junta gave him all sort of preferential treatment. They become first-class citizens in Myanmar. Whether it is mining jade or other resources it is the CHina who owns them all. It is like how British is the first-class citizen in Hong Kong. They start to pull like No Burmese allowed in their restaurant or business in Myanmar like How the British did in HK \" no Chinese or dogs allowed sign in HK\" in the century of humiliation. just Yesterday, a Chinese employer summoned a Myanmar employee to make a payment. but he didn't pay the promised amount and he called the soldiers to shoot the employees when they demand the promised amount. 5 deaths 70 arrested, 4 more death later. Chinese embassy and Beijing cover up all their corruption and neo-colony style dealing in their media in turn, they support the dictator in Myanmar. btw the Japan Chamber of commerce did the same. They tried to pull the same shit as the Chinese group did. But when the truth is surfaced, Japan's foreign ministry didn't cover-up. They give us Justice. that is the fking difference. also, the Chinese embassador to Myanmar is a fkiing corrupted shit. The way he manage the relationship in Myanmar is just giving a hand to CIA campaign against smearing China.\n",

If that was the case, a joint task force of the UK, US and half the EU would have intervened already, with or without UN backing.

So in this case, countries such as China and in ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines are obstacles to any meaningful pressure on the coup leadership. Many, if not most, foreigners and their countries dearly wish that they can do more but limitations are there...still whenever there is opportunities, they will do what they can. Still, these terrorists will not go unpunished... the world will hold them accountable to the bloody and despicable acts against their own countrymen. Do not lose hope, you will succeed in the end...

      "\n",
      "1. As far as my knowledge goes, China's reason for abstaining from UNSC's condemnation is due to how it would result to a global economic sanction for Myanmar. This, however, is not only ineffective, it is actually harming the common people more than it is the Junta. It has been shown how five decades of economic sanction only resulted in Myanmar's (then Burma) economy and politic getting isolated from the outside world, hence making it harder for any foreign sovereign nation-state to justify taking a meaningful action towards Myanmar. Simply put, Myanmar is far too isolated, no one cares. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Even worse, sanctions would hurt the quality of the common people because there would be less investment, less job opportunites, less wealth for the common people to use for education, internet, and many other improvement for life quality. This translates to people not educated, not intelligent, not willing enough to fight against the junta. Both these reasons given by China are valid enough imho. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider China's internal politics. China itself is an authoritarian government, hence they cannot \"openly\" support any democratic movement on foreign soil because such actions would only destabilize China, and China hates instability in their government. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Myanmar is a direct neighbor to China and having an unstable, or even worse, a civil war state just beside you is a nightmare. China \"supports\" the junta simply because junta is the only faction that has the highest chance to stabilize the country. Hence, China's support for the junta. If the junta were to fail in the near future, then China would gladly support the next-in-line faction capable of stabilizing Myanmar. \n",

      "Comment: Ah yeah, where were you when hyper nationalistic \"Buddhist\"patriots were quietly supporting the genocide of 24,000 Rohingya and the ethnic cleansing of over a million innocent men women and children, eh? Now you know how it feels. Why should any westerner support people that have no respect or value the benefits of tolerance and ethnic diversity and embrace the values of such a society? Don't give me a reason cause you haven't got one except the innocent children that have not yet been corrupted by the communities that they depended on to teach them right from wrong and good from evil instead of infecting them with racial, ethnic and religious hatred, as you attempt to justify a genocide. That's not very Buddhist is it now. If you had stood up for the Royhinga perhaps the Tatmadaw wouldn't have become so empowered by your acceptance of such atrocities and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately it is now your innocent children that are going to be mentally scared by your ambivalence, disrespect and lack of empathy and abandonment of morals and ethics as you now become the victims of your fate.\n",

Only reason there's no UN coalition on the ground is because China didn't want to anger the military, as they are currently guarding gas pipelines that run into China, which have been targets for activists, and Russia wants to keep messing money selling them arms, and unfortunately the two countries that benefit the most from this also happen to be two of the biggest seats in the UNSBut yeah, otherwise, these guys are seen as evil around the world and if Starlink could say that one of their first major uses was tookeep democratic activists connected to each other and to the outside world amidst an authoritarian internet blackout by an illegitimate government...

I remember when I first found out I was outside the warehouse I work at smoking a cigarette waiting to start work when I saw the article pop up on my news feed. And at the warehouse a lot of my fellow coworkers are from Myanmar and I remember that day when the military overthrew the government quite a few of my coworkers had not shown up for work. I overheard my bosses being racist and  muttering \"all :those people' just called off and now we are shorthanded.\" When we had our start of shift meeting when my manager asked if anyone had questions I stood out in front of everyone and told them what had just happened and that the company should not penalize or talk down about any of the workers who called off work because the country of Myanmar has been turned upside down and so most likely were probably too distraught to even get out of bed. A couple came up later and said they were suprised  that I knew and cared about their situation since I have no ties to Myanmar.   I replied that I simply just love all people and I despise evil.

George floyd got his neck kneeled on for how long??? Cops executed a no knock warrant and killed breanna taylor, shot Jacob Blake 7 times I can go on and on but you just rather ignore the fact that it's true I never once said the myanmar military was like the American police force either I said that the comment of how they detained him for no reason, and beat him is like what the american cops do.\n",

There were a lot of corruption cases both from the civilian government and the military.  Both have their own fair share of corruption.\n",

      "Comment: And that is btw a very generous number. I know many many family members of the military (who usually after receiving a western education and/or living abroad) who have learned the truth of how the military operates here and many have either abandoned their families or have been disowned by them. Earlier on during the coup, one of the more prominent protesters killed after arrest was the brother of the chief of police in Myanmar. So basically I am saying that even in the military families, many of the youths who are not brainwashed are abandoning them. Of course they do not usually make a big deal out of this, as they are afraid the people will still despise them for the actions of their families.\n",

Funny how the UN is all about protecting “democracy” and “the people” until there’s a situation where they could actually do so. I do understand the geopolitical sensitivity with China being so close though so it’s a tight rope act at this point supplying aid. How much of the population is made up of Bamar groups vs the ethnic minority militias? Was it the Bamar people actually cooperating with the Junta or just being stuck between a rock and a hard place? The majority of Americans don’t like the war in the Middle East, that doesn’t stop the military from continuing to occupy it, yet people assume all Americans have imperial idealizations.\n",

Of course when I say leftist I mean literal leftist: communist, socialist, demsocs, anarchist, and leftist much like myself. liberals (liberals aren’t leftist) were very much unaware and the only reason they know now is because they’ve invaded leftist spaces. I digress. If you would like to see something even more crazy than our news in the US not covering this you should stick around and wait. If that POS Min Aung Hlaing succeeds in the coup. The US will extend beneficial trade within years regardless of who’s in office. Our current reaction to this is very small sanctions on a handful of the individuals at fault for this. Which does quite honestly nothing. Now this is void of any party. Both Democrats and Republicans support this bipartisanly. And when that dictator of yours is re-elected in 4 years he’s going to continue to support this. So do keep a close eye and watch how flimsy US politicians are.\n",

The state councilor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the president U Win Print ( NLD) are still the leaders we accepted and voted. The excuse the military gave, for detaining them was a fraudulent in ballots which is an insult to us, since the majority of us actually voted for the NLD party. I think if you make more research, you will find out the military was the one who has always been kissing China’s a** and left the country in debt. The cronies are them. Their relatives and families are the richest in the country. They had took over the country consecutively in 1962,1988,1990 (NLD won election in 1990 but the military refused to handover) until 2011. (Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest for 15 years and her members were in jail or in exile during those days).However, it was only in 2015 the NLD party won the second election and took in charge of the country in 2016. It has only been 4 years that the country has been really developing and it wasn’t even pure democracy since the military was still in charge for 25% of the parliament. But it was a lot better. The military left the country in China’s debt and the NLD has been dealing with them ever since. They are the true leaders and they are our only hope. I hope this clear up for you. The military is the nightmare and both lions and hyenas to us. If you want reliable sources, articles and books to make further research on this, please kindly let me know and I’m more that happy to provide you with references.\n",

Internal racism is rife in Myanmar, they are not a ‘union’ at all, but NLD is the best hope they have at the moment. But that issue will not be solved now, democracy needs to be the priority at the moment imho. In the future, they’re probably bette to be some collection of states / countries more on a EU style ... they have no common vision or cause and likely never will have. When so many ppl introduce them themselves as ‘Bamar’, ‘Chin’, ‘Shan’, ‘Kachin’, ‘Rakhine’ etc NOT as ‘Myanmar’ ... that says it all. And as usual, religion is another cause of trouble, ASSK does not want the Muslims either, she just won’t say it. One problem at a time. Now the military are sprouting BS with Bangladesh saying they want to take the Rohingya back ... they’re the ones who drove them out and committed genocide ! The country is a mess, but at least democracy was improving ppl’s lives and VERY SLOWLY heading in some sort of right direction. btw, the MMR education system is the worst I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world.\n",

Again, I am not familiar and it's hard to discern who are good guys in these types of situations since politicians are generally not the most honest people. That said, a lot of the West is having a hard time siding with any side, even Aung San Suu Kyi, because it appeared she either condoned or was ambivalent to the genocide of Muslims.

Majority of Myanamr are racist towards Muslims (if they were to be honest with themselves, which they will not be), but that problem needs to move to 2nd or later place at the moment. fyi, if ASSK were not a forced puppet of the military, or at least having to try to placate them as they essentially control the parliament by virtue of their 25% control, she may actually try to find a real Rohingya solution [she may actually even call them that instead of north Rakhine ppl (!)], as much as i don’t like it, she and the NLD are the lesser of the evils. As for the next generation of leaders ... she’s 75yro ... no competent successors that I’ve seen ...\n",

For Ukraine, a bigger country invaded them and other neighboring countries could potentially be invaded by Russia in the future if they fail to stop Russia. But ours, it’s just the top dogs torturing it’s citizens. As much as I hate the current situation in myanmar, I don’t think we should b SOUR about the fact that Ukraine is getting more attention than us. We ourselves turned a blind eye to the atrocities that the ethnic people have been dealing with all over those years. Let’s just make sure the world doesn’t forget about the crisis in myanmar after they have solved the Ukrainian problem.\n",

      "Comment: My perspective as a Burmese person living in America:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ones an invasion by a foreign entity, the other one is a coup that most countries will consider \"internal affairs\" (like China). Governments around the world could definitely do more including sanction the junta, but they primarily do business with China who has very very similar ideological views. China would vehemently disagree with taking any action in Myanmar because if and when they have similar military action in Taiwan/Hong Kong, which in their view is China, they'll also consider it an \"internal affair\" that other countries shouldn't interfere with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important point. In the eyes of other countries, if Ukraine falls then countries like Romania, Moldova, Latvia, etc. could also fall to Russia. The invasion spiraling into WWIII is a scary thought for most of the west. Compare that to the military coup which no doubt has its consequences but will very likely not affect the EU in any way (and will be isolated to Myanmar). Spoiler alert: countries only like to help when they have something to gain or when political actions could protect their future. Plus, Ukraine is right on Nato's doorstep, whereas Myanmar is an entirely different neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, one of the biggest forms of support is the US providing military aid (in the form of weapons, planes, tanks, etc.) to Ukraine. There is still a stable government and military in Ukraine. Who would the US provide military aid to in Myanmar? Sure there are certain militaries and militias, but before this coup even began, everyone was fighting everyone. Providing arms to any group will just worsen things in my view, especially once there's a power vacuum.\n",

Nearly all of the wars currently occuring can be traced back as a result to centuries of colonialism. So, they don't care at all if Myanmar or Haiti or other nations like them are suffering.

      "\n",
      "Fuck those who say it's karma, I feel sorry for every ordinary Burmese citizen. BUT unfortunately, lots of people in Myanmar drank the propaganda kool-aid and believed that there wasn't a Rohingya genocide going on, and the world saw the denial. At least it seems like the majority of Russians know what's happening is wrong. It's one thing if Burmese were standing up to their military before the coup in terms of Rohingya + Kareni + others genocide, but they weren't. I understand that all ethnicities (even Bamar) have had struggles with the military, but as things started getting more free and better for Bamar people, it seems we forgot the atrocities the military has inflicted on us and had an \"all good as long as it isn't affecting me anymore\" attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the entire country is fucked by the coup, everyone wants to come to the side of Rohingyas and how we have always been on the same \"team\". Sure, we all always said \"fuck the military\", but no... most Burmese people didn't even believe anything was going on with the Rohingyas or denied it. Most of the Democratically elected government turned a blind eye to it in fears of sparking the military's outrage. \n",
      "\n",
      "All I saw before was denial of what was happening. I would occasionally see messages, even on this sub about how real the struggles the Rohingya were that they were going through, but they'd be shot down with typical propaganda... \"they're foreigners, they aren't Burmese, nothing is happening\". \n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR**: Just a mini-rant. Really wish more Burmese people would've stood up for the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities before shit hit the fan with the coup. Many Burmese people seemed to have forgotten about their history with the military and the pain they've inflicted as things got better, and turned a blind eye to the geocides.\n",

      "Many years ago they came into what was then called Burma as illegal immigrants that entered the country.  They are originally from Bangladesh.  They never bothered to obtain legal status.  Keep in mind this was several decades ago.  They demanded that the Burmese Government, at that time military regime, give them a pretty large portion of the northern part of the country.  The military regime refused.  So they went to the international stage to try to get countries to support them and force the military regime to give a large portion of land to them.  No nation would support what they wanted.  \n",

      "Fast forward to about 5-6 years ago when Auntie Sue and the NLD won a fair democratic election, they saw the opportunity to once again spin their story to try to get the NLD and newly elected leaders to recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar.  Of course the newly elected leaders refused.  So they started attacking people again.\n",

      "What the media failed to report was that the Rohingya were attacking non-muslim citizens.  But Al Jazeera reported it as the military under the new leadership that was killing the Rohingya.

How can we find out if there are places where we can meet, issues on which we can work together, unless we talk to one another? But I heard a rather shocking report about on of the SLORC ministers by a foreign journalist. The minister said you can do anything with money. If you hold a ten dollar note above a grave, a hand wll come out to reach it. And if you held out a hundred dollar note, the whole body would come out.\" That seems to indicate that they have no principals whatsoever.

The difference being when China, Soviet, Turkey, and India did the same thing, you could actually blame them and point a big fat finger to whoever actually responsible, like how the world treat Xi Jinping today.

There are also a ton of old m16s that the government issued to police it seems.

At first glance the barrel looks a little bit long to be an actual M4 but I could be wrong.

Islamophobia is a huge thing here and there's a big reason kids with darker skin tones get bullied and called \"Kalar\" (which is a word mostly used to make fun of races and ethnicities with darker skin tones) And that's all coming from personal experience. As for the aligned part, there are Buddhist extremists set up by the military and those are different from the usual Buddhist monks. There's a guy called Wirathu and he's the biggest example of what I'm saying, sadly a lot of people seem to fall for their anti-muslim propaganda. Ethnic minorities straight up face terror attacks from the military as well. So they have it a lot worse than us. They've been oppressed for decades.\n",

Even when we wanted to admit the patient to the hospital, that so-called private hospital and Government hospital asked the signs of the local resident.

I listed many other reasons why your fears of these protests being superspreading events are not justified, almost everyone wearing masks in this video were just one of them. And my mention of masks being worn is regarding the protest in this video, not about the protests in February. There is little evidence to suggest the protests in February were some superspreading event as case counts did not explode until months later well after the mass protests. The third wave also started to grow exponentially first in Chin and western Sagaing, which you would expect it to start in places like Mandalay and Yangon if the massive protests truly were super spreader events like you fear. \n",

      "Comment: I'm more of the skeptical and careful sort. I know it's a controversial take but the blm protests may have contributed somewhat to the spread of covid in America. Same goes for protests in Myanmar as well. I believe it's better to be safe than sorry, especially given the state the medical infrastructure in Myanmar is in. I'm not saying not to protest, but it's probably the best to find other creative ways to protest that doesn't involve going out in person. This is just my opinion. I want my countrymen to be alive and well.\n",

Virus is spreading and the strains is different from others. In the first two waves, we didn't have that kind of oxygen demand like we are having now. It is much more transmissible than the other two waves we were having. Besides, I believe most of these people are not vaccinated. I am not saying we shouldn't protest but not this time (especially in populated city like Yangon) where healthcare is a nightmare right now.\n",

I think the reason covid wasn't big headlines after the coup was either due to suppression by the junta or because of low detection rate. It might have mutated during those months and is now even more infectious and deadly than ever. I feel like during these times it's best to be as safe as possible especially due to lack of medical care. We really don't know what we are dealing with.\n",

      "Comment: I love Myanmar, visited, and donated before (and same with Hong Kong as I used to work there) and hope it gets the attention it deserves. But what I don’t see in posts like these is an understanding in the difference between a foreign country invading and an internal civil war/coup, even if the coup has outside influence or support. Many countries see that difference and take very different responses between the two, however bad the situation is. If Taiwan is invaded by china it should get the same support Ukraine is but it’s sad that it probably won’t because too many countries don’t recognize it. It’s also sad that the level of support is related to the resources desired from the country (oil, gas, Ukraine has huge amounts, minerals, technology (TSMC)). It doesn’t help that Myanmar was cut off from the world for so many decades before. Continue to leverage the attention people are giving Ukraine into attention for Myanmar, etc just also understand some of the differences that are the basis of the different level of response.\n",

      "\n",
      "The police of Myanmar are not like a normal police force that in theory answer to local and higher civilian authorities. The Myanmar police are essentially another wing of the military apparatus. The head of the Myanmar police is Than Hlaing, a member of the military who holds the rank of lieutenant-general. He has been implicated in the brutal suppression of the protests and also is going to lead a bloody offensive against resistance groups in Northwest Myanmar. The Myanmar police answer to the Ministry of Home Affairs which is controlled by another general. And of course this general answers to Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the junta. This was even true during the days of semi-civilian rule- the civilian government never controlled the police force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police of Myanmar have long been a crucial force in arresting, torturing, killing and imprisoning dissidents. They took part in the brutal crackdowns of protesters in the early days of the uprising. The police stand side by side with the core military in \"clearance\" operations against ethnic armed groups. The distinction between the police and military is a meaningless one.\n",

      "To put it in perspective, this uprising in Myanmar started off completely peaceful. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, took to the streets and people overwhelmingly tried their best to not commit any violent acts against the police and military. People went on strike to join the Civil Disobedience Movement. Demonstrators were giving flowers and water to police and soldiers and were begging them to stand for the people. Do you know what happened? Soldiers and the same police you feel sad about dying launched a vicious crackdown. Security forces open fired with live ammunition against peaceful protesters, killing hundreds and injuring far more. Thousands of activists and protesters were thrown in prison and some imprisoned ended up being tortured to death. Women have been sexually assaulted. People were literally set on fire by the junta's forces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even in spite of this violence, Burmese people tried to respond with self-defensive measures like building barricades, wearing helmets, using shields and only throwing things like Molotov cocktails if the soldiers and police responded with more violence. The junta continued to just indiscriminately and disproportionately slaughter more protesters. The military laid siege to entire neighborhoods. Soldiers would come dead in the night and abduct an activist, only to return his corpse in the morning. Despite all of this, very little police and soldiers defected at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the dictatorship escalated its use of violence and murder against its own people, that is finally when Myanmar people started to organize themselves in militia and guerrilla groups to resist the military through armed resistance. And so you started to get the bombings, assassinations and shootings like you see in this video. And you know what has happened since since the start of armed resistance? More and more soldiers and police have deserted the regime. The civil administration of the junta has collapsed in large swathes of the country because of the threat of retribution by PDF groups but also to show their opposition to the military. The resistance groups have managed to inflict heavy casualties against the military. And because of this and the huge unpopularity of the military, the number of soldiers and police the junta has is steadily declining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Killing the \"softest targets\" does in fact serve a purpose. It overstretches the military as they have to commit resources into cities like Yangon and Mandalay rather than using all of their troops to crush resistance in the hinterlands. It gives more incentive for security forces to defect as they know longer can feel that sticking with the junta as the safest option for their wellbeing. It prevents the regime from fully consolidating its power. And all signs so far points to the strategy of armed resistance the pro-democracy groups have employed as working. \n",
      "\n",
      "And no, I don't think you can claim \"a drive-by shooting is still a drive-by shooting\". The circumstances of this shooting and general armed resistance in Myanmar is far different than the ones in developed countries and even many developing countries. These police aren't like the police in most of Europe and the US where they answer directly to civilian administration. The police are essentially a wing of the military as they report directly to the generals an Min Aung Hlaing, even during the previous semi-civilian administration. Myanmar police have long participated in destroying dissent as it is part of their job as their literal employer is the junta. Police have even fought alongside the military in wars against ethnic armed organizations. Police are not some innocent bystanders as you seem to think they are. \n",
      "\n",
      "And you know why some Burmese celebrate these killings? Because since the coup, and honestly decades of brutal military misrule, the hated military is finally on the receiving end of violence. Burmese people spent the last eight and half months watching people they care about being beaten and killed in the streets. Many streets in Yangon, Mandalay and other cities were literally stained with blood from the massacres the military and police inflected against protesters and the population as a whole. I suggest you seriously keep in mind before you judge Burmese people from likely a position of immense privilege.\n",

What the Nazis did during WW2 was undeniably wrong, however the German army as a whole is not guilty for what the Nazis did. The bulk of German soldiers were every day people that went to war for their country yet you let the few that were truly evil corrupt your view on them as a whole. Now look at what our country has done overseas in previous wars. Rape, torture, contributing to civilian deaths and deploying agent orange which has led to birth defects. Do you believe we are all guilty of these crimes? I’d argue we aren’t because the vast majority of our troops, just like the Germans, are people trying to get by in life and fought for their country. The Myanmar military vs the Burmese people as a whole follows the same concept.  “One rotten apple spoils the whole barrel.”\n",

The media never reported when they killed her right hand Muslim man to threaten her to push her up against the world stage. If she went against the military actions, what do you think would've happened to her. Either detained/killed like him. She sacrificed more than half of her life for the people and the country instead of spending time with her kids and grandchilds in UK. Everyone is quick to point fingers at her.

I realize you are likely a Muslim yourself given your intense passion for your brothers being killed, and it trully is awful, but having the military in complete control will 100% worsen the situation for the poor Rohingya. The military has shown how little they care about their own country.\n",

At the very least the entire officer and NCO corps should have been shot and were most government employees who worked in those governments before the war started and stayed on until the end.

Our only hope is for other countries' government to help release our citizens rights and free the government party which was elected by the general public. The military didn't want the democratic party, NLD, to reduce their power and authority, so they have been inciting many polical propaganda and political unrest. And now they took over the government as an excuse for unrest and protests within the country which was actually started by them. The Rohingya genocide crisis was mainly handled by the military which the democratic party have no control over. Although, when Gambia took this case to the Supreme Court of Justice. The one to clean up their mess was the main leader of the democratic party, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Still we can't blame the military for all of it, it was the citizens fault also. I deeply apologize. The future is surely uncertain for all citizens, but i pray and hope that all stay safe and healthy.\n",

Imagine for a second you were a Tatmadaw soldier patrolling the streets and you would be in constant fear of getting blown up or shot by some guy on a motorbike. If we are honest this constant fear will only increase your hatred and even if you were sympathetic to the NUG before you might change your mind and start hating them instead.\n",

So many lives are lost for no reason. And you can bet the ones on top of the food chain get richer every day.

      "Comment: Ever heard of 'discrimination', pal? Yep, that is the reason. The military shows no empathy since Feb 1st. We now know what  a monster they are or how cruel they are. Some Chinese on social media claimed that the coup was sponsored by the CIA, which is absurd. They've been living under the CCP propaganda for too long so I don't expect much of a help from the Chinese people. Why the fuck would they sympathize with us if they don't even know the truth?\n",

The military have their own circle and isn't much connected to the general population, they follow him because he's a trusted officer who proved himself in past conflicts, and they trust him because the army is their life. Yet out of that, Min Aung Hlaing has nothing to offer, because he has no presence outside the military. He is someone who truly have no support whatsoever among any civilian of whatever political spectrum, that's quite a staggering accomplishment. One can only accept his legitimacy through submission, so **violence would be the one and only tool by which he rule**. He would not risk spreading it too thin.\n",

You have a soviet friendly leader, CIA kills him and replaced with a a junta. Got a US friendly leader, send in the KGB and replace them with a Soviet friendly one. Its unfair to say violent revolution doesnt work by its nature when a big part of why it doesnt work are powerful countries making sure its so. “They replace them with another” only makes sense if “they” are the powerful countries with an interest in instating a tyrant with friendly foreign policy(to their state).

During the day if you got your neighbours and such to organize and collect large rocks/ boulders during the day, and then when they patrol the streets at night, hide on your balcony and wait until they're right under you, and then throw the rocks on them. From this height if you had a ~30 or 40 lb rock it would easily kill them. Make them fear you instead of the other way around.\n",

      "Comment: That's true. I think I read that 3000 have defected already. Which is quite a good amount. But the lack of places to go combined with how risky it is is definitely a problem. Authoritarian regimes are making a big comeback but the issues with Myanmar seems to be that no one wants to get involved. And unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, they(the Junta) have a way out by getting recognition. More recognition that The Taliban. ASEAN may recognize the Junta soon and that'll be....pretty bad. Cambodia's leader mentioned wanted to recognize them as legit just yesterday I believe. Many of the nations in ASEAN aren't free btw I feel that also may cause recognition of the Taliban and other extreme regimes, Who knows though. I think Myanmar will be in a true civil war soon. They have many groups training and many of the Rohingya who were getting killed by the Army before are now teaming up with other groups who have seen now for their own eyes how bad the Army actually is to innocent citizens. That's the thing about Democratic backsliding, the next step is sometimes war and then lots of turmoil and distrust and sometimes coups and *eventually* possibly maybe democracy again. Depends on a lot of factors though and they vary in each situation.\n",

      "Comment: Ok as an American who has been following the conflict I have been noticing a lot of pics of the PDF with what seem to be guns sourced from the US civilian market. The first picture both of the rifles look like the ARs you would commonly find on the civilian market in the US. Like I am almost certain the guys rifle on the left is a palmetto state armory AR-15. The second photo is hard to see the writing but that optic looks a lot like one sold by primary arms in the US. The third photo the guy is very clearly holding a ruger precision rifle which is common in the US as a budget precision rifle. Usually when the US government supplies forces clandestinely they use guns that would be commonly found in the region so my best guess is some absolutely chads are risking prison sentences to get the PDF guns. The suppressors all look like they have been made there.\n",

Currently it's still open because banks relied on it. With technical support of china they might not need to rely on it soon. So getting US support for people is crucial be it in the form of starlink. Even if they banned import of the satellite dishes, it can be done by illegal routes.

Have arbitrary arrests and torture ended? Has the civilian government been released? Has the junta softened its language at all?\n",

      "The answer to all the questions above is a resounding no. Instead, many in Myanmar continue to die whether they are directly killed by the military or they die by COVID. The Tatmadaw have shown no signs that they will change course. ASEAN cannot even agree to a special envoy.

Meanwhile, the Tatmadaw is far more of a ubiquitous institution that is not based around single figures.

Something that the ASEAN summit and current engagement has backfired horribly with. The problem is that you repeatedly downplay ASEAN's complicity in giving the Tatmadaw legitimacy. Denying diplomatic legitimacy does hurt the Tatmadaw's standing. Otherwise they would not be obsessed with getting reporters to stop referring to them as a junta nor would they be be so eager to post pictures and videos of meetings with ASEAN, Russia and China. The fact is that ASEAN has been a terrible ally to Myanmar and diplomatic pressure would certainly help weaken the regime. \n",

In fact, it only seemed to have legitimized the regime further which is what this meme is poking fun at. The reason why Myanmar people continue to express anger at the UN and ASEAN is because neither body has done enough for Myanmar. Will the anger do anything? You are right it will not.

As I have talked about in my other posts, international acceptance is something the junta craves and why they hired a lobbyist to try to whitewash their image abroad (which that plan has since failed due to sanctions). Recognition of the NUG deprives them of that legitimacy and can potentially free up frozen government assets that could be directed to the NUG. These actions alone won't topple the Tatmadaw, but it certainly will make it closer to a reality.\n",

Responding back with hate and vulgar words to your comments will help you go nowhere. Be open to suggestions, if I am wrong I'll admit it thus, gaining a different perspective or knowledge. Not everything is as it seems. There are Rohingyas who are supporting the people movement. And Living peacefully with the locals for years or even thousands of years like you mentioned in Arakan area.  But, did you know majority of them take advantage claiming to have stayed there for generation, but in truth they are illegals from Bangladesh. \n",
      "(Taken from Wikipedia Rohingya People)\n",
      "     The Rohingya maintain they are indigenous to western Myanmar with a heritage of over a millennium and influence from the Arabs, Mughals and Portuguese. The community claims it is descended from people in precolonial Arakan and colonial Arakan; historically, the region was an independent kingdom between Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The Myanmar government considers the Rohingya as colonial and postcolonial migrants from neighbouring Chittagong/East Bengal respectively Bangladesh. \n",
      "     It argues that a distinct precolonial Muslim population recognized as KAMAN, and that the Rohingya CONFLATE their history with the history of ARAKAN MUSLIMS in general to advance a separatist agenda. In addition, Myanmar's government does not recognise the term \"Rohingya\" .\n",

      "Comment: Well, the thing is, for kids it's just a simple necklace. Sometimes only 2 to 3 rings. It isn't tight. And that is if they wish to wear it. How many rings you wish to add as you grow up is kind of up to you. The rings you see on kids are pictures of Thai tourist traps. so it isn't a cultural thing to make kids wear a lot anymore. Plus, many have stopped wearing them in most part of the country because of practicality purposes, many sold their brass rings while fleeing civil war. In fact it is usually the owners of tourist traps that \"encourage\" the women to keep wearing them for more tourist money. And since most of them are refugees, they can't exactly go against what the tourist spots want since it is usually their only source of income. Its kind of ill informed to say that the culture is \"forcing\" it upon the younger ones when many in the culture are already reasonably wearing it or giving it up. Instead we blame the culture even though the ones that make headline news are the ones from tourist destinations who were made to play up their tribal factor\n",

      "\"The government of Myanmar began discouraging neck rings as it struggled to appear more modern to the developed world. Consequently, many women in Myanmar began breaking the tradition, though a few older women and some of the younger girls in remote villages continued to wear rings. In Thailand, the practice has gained popularity in recent years, because it draws tourists who bring revenue to the tribe and to the local businessmen who run the villages and collect an entry fee of 500 to 600 baht per person. \n",

      "In January 2008, the UNHCR expressed reservations about tourists visiting the Kayan villages in Northern Thailand due to the provincial government’s refusal to allow registered Kayan refugees to take up offers of resettlement in developed countries.[11] It is believed this policy was linked to their economic importance to the area. This policy was relaxed in late 2008 and a small group of Kayan have left for New Zealand in August 2008.[12] Others entered the main Karenni refugee camp (which is not open to tourists) in September 2008 and they are now eligible for resettlement.\"\n",

While we may have done a single genocide over 50 years ago you lot do it practically every Tuesday whether it's against the Karen, Rohingya or even against yourselves. Quit acting like monkeys and evolve a little by civilising yourselves and recognising the bad shit you've done. Otherwise don't dare moan about the situation and ask the world for help. Because you genocidal lot certainly don't deserve it. But by all means continue to tear yourselves apart if it makes you feel better. We'll just enjoy watching from afar :)\n",

      "Regarding the claim that people on this Reddit are local minorities, I don't really see evidence of that. Other forms of Myanmar social media like Twitter, Instagram and especially Facebook have been far more active in promoting the uprising and supporting it however they can. Almost every Myanmar person I know wants to see this uprising through to the end. And no, it isn't just privileged urban people and Myanmar people abroad promoting armed resistance and protests. The places that saw the longest lasting and most intense protests were many of the small towns, countryside and impoverished satellite neighborhoods of Yangon. The strongholds of armed resistance since the coup have been places like Chin, Karenni, Sagaing, Kachin and Magwe- not exactly places I would think of as being overly privileged. Hundreds of thousands of workers remain on strike- and many of these government jobs are not exactly glamorous either. The idea that the NUG is just exploiting people to fight a war is ridiculous. Myanmar people, including those from disadvantaged communities, have agencies of their own. Myanmar people made the overwhelming choice to continue to fight against the junta even if it costs them dearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do they keep fighting? Because they know that there is little to no choice unless they want to live under the Tatmadaw's boots for the rest of their lives. The junta has not fundamentally changed and is still the same brutal, irrational actor it has been for over 60 years. As long as they continue to rule, the health and education systems will continue to be neglected. Ethnic minorities will continue to be subject to the same oppression they have been for decades and continue to experience horrors like extrajudicial killings, their villages being burnt down and mass rape. Tens of thousands of people are likely to die of otherwise preventable diseases. Horrors like Hurricane Nargis or the recent COVID wave will continue to devastate the country under the military's mismanagement. The military will still kidnap, imprison, torture and kill political dissidents. Countless people will still die regardless of whether people choose to take up arms or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I am not even sure why you bother to bring up Aung San Suu Kyi. It is irrelevant whether or not she would support the declaration of war or armed uprising in general. She has been imprisoned for over seven months and can barely communicate with the country at large under these circumstances. It does not really help that Aung San Suu Kyi's strategy of non-violence clearly has not worked to uproot the military as a political institution in the country anyways. It is pretty clear that it is the Myanmar public at large that chose to rise up against the military regime. Is it an uphill battle? Yes, and people do know that. Are they willing to continue regardless because there is essentially no alternatitive? Absolutely.\n",

Yet, I saw cops dragging 100% peaceful protesters onto the ground and throwing them in vans, slamming people with riot shields, pepper spraying when there was no provocation. And even if the crowds got rowdy at some point, the way in which the cops responded was always out of hand. For instance, the crowd would throw a water bottle into the line of cops and the cops would open fire with their crowd control guns, a totally disproportionate response. \n",

The movement was a largely organic response to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s murder and police brutality in general, which is RAMPANT in this country. \n",

Their influence is marginal at best—they have a media arm and a couple of Maoist front groups they operate through, but these organizations are fringe and a joke to most people. \n",

      "And if anything is true, the CCP is trying to smear your movement in Myanmar! I sometimes read the propaganda websites that we have because I think it’s important to figure out how they are lying and spinning the truth. There is one that is notorious for defending human rights abuses in China, Russia, and Syria—it’s called Grayzone, if you are interested. And the last article they have about Myanmar is smearing your movement and independent journalists in the country, accusing them of being potential tools for a US imperialist regime-change operation. The implication of the article was that we should be wary of supporting protesters in Myanmar, because, they say, these protesters are probably just tools for the US government and they are being used to attack China and Russia. Now you live in Myanmar. I bet you realize how stupid that sounds! And yet that’s the propaganda that the folks who apologize for the CCP are spreading in my country. The way you are talking about BLM, it sounds like they must be running a similar operation where you are. It wouldn’t surprise me AT ALL to learn they are attempting to smear and discredit activists in the US to prevent international solidarity between our people.\n",

      "Comment: The riots are but a symptom of a movement that is still finding its voice and it’s power after decades of defeat. As MLK said, “a riot is the language of the unheard.” In all likelihood, given the current trajectory of progressive forces in the US, these riots will develop and transform into disciplined mass actions in the years to come. And those of us with a global outlook will not forget the struggle in Myanmar once we have built the power to lend you true solidarity. Perhaps one day, when and if international forces become strong enough, our movements will have the infrastructure and earned trust necessary to organize an [International Brigade](https://alba-valb.org/) to fight the fascists like they did in the Spanish Civil War.\n",

If the Junta win, the whole country will become under control of China. Actually, democracy will solve everything if the country will get good leadership, unity of the Civilians and no velein like China and the Junta.\n",

      "What kind of goods do Burmese people want to create? Right now Myanmar are copying China by having their factories and taking their foreign investment, you need to keep copying until you are able to have the FDI (foreign direct investment) to create new industries. Unfortunately if there is no political stability nobody would invest in Myanmar, not even China. It's crazy that Myanmar are copying China, taking their money, but you are claiming China are copycats as if Myanmar is not doing what China did in 1979.\n",

      "To be honest you sound very delusional, I'm sorry but even Japan and Korea did start \"creating\" out of nowhere. Japan started copying US electronics and car factories like Ford after WW2 and Korea started copying household electronic factories from USA and Japan (see Samsung, LG) like Carrier aircon, Sony, Sharp, Toshiba after the Korean war. Every country starts by doing some low-end manufacturing then moves to high-end goods. Even China started from manufacturing toys, clothes, etc then high-end goods like Iphones(US IT brand), Xiaomi, Huawei, Midea (China tech brand) etc. You want Myanmar to start creating but where is the foreign investment and where will the skills come from? Even the way you think is too simplistic, have you attended university? Even a woman working in a factory in China helps China's economy because they gain useful industrial skills more than a Burmese maid working overseas helps Burma's economy. Being a maid isn't a transferable skill. Philippines and Indonesia have sent a lot of women overseas to work as maids and those countries are still poor. Myanmar is going down that path sadly.\n",

      "Myanmar and its people need to figure how to stand up (manufacture low end goods, attract foreign investment and not burn down foreign investors factories or why should they invest in Myanmar?) before you can create anything or copy China/Korea/Japan. Do you think any Myanmar IT  brand can ever be world famous like Samsung, Sony, LG, Huawei, Xiaomi unless you copy Korea, Japan, China's development model for 20 years first? Myanmar needs foreign investor money so they can stop sending women overseas to be maids, step 1 is to not burn down foreign factories and stop shooting your own foot first. Idiots.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyway you gotta stop conflating politics and economy. Myanmar cannot hope to get rich without doing a lot of low-end manufacturing first like China/Japan/Korea/Singapore/Taiwan/Vietnam (hopefully foreign countries like China, Japan, Taiwan still want to invest) and then moving slowly to high end manufacturing after many decades. It may take 35 years to reach China's level now if ever at all. Your people need to understand that stability = wealth, and try their best to avoid major political upheaval because it's terrible for the economy. Of course your cause is valid and democracy is important, but democracy doesn't lead to wealth. Politics and economy has no link. You keep saying Myanmar people are poor, yes mainly because of corruption not democracy/authoritarianism. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overthrow the military, and the democratic parties can still be corrupt (lots of South Korean presidents get jailed for bribes, corruption etc). Anyway, South Korea is proof that even with a lot of political upheavals (Gwangju massacre, protests) they can still become a manufacturing powerhouse. I'm not sure if Myanmar has skills for that but if women work as maids overseas your economy can never grow. They contribute way more as low-end factory workers in Myanmar because the bigger those low end manufacturing factories are, the faster you atttact more foreign investors and move to mid/high end manufacturing. Some Burmese will start copying foreign MNCs manufacturing process and set up similar brand goods, then Myanmar will be more \"self sufficient\" with its own country's brands of clothes, electronics or IT.  That process will take a long time but there is no magic bullet to get rich, you also don't need democracy to grow your economy, look at China.\n",

Thing is genocide in Myanmar has been happening since WW2. it's not really an anti muslim thing. The miliary treats everyone minority and even the Burmese majority, equally by killing everyone. Doesn't really matter if your God tells you not to eat Beef or Pork. It just isn't a problem for them. Myanmar has the longest civil war in history. Still going on now but since other minorities in Myanmar aren't muslims, it doesn't sound tasty enough for the western media to report.\n",

Well tbh, everyone knows it's the military but still now there is no one important behind bars. The military virtually operates as a seperate entity and answers to the military commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, the guy who took power now. They don't need to listen to ASSK according to the constitution that they wrote. The military are owners of a lot of conglomerates too. \n",

The constitution that they wrote allows them to do so. For Suu Kyi the little progess that has been made would be wiped out. Not defending the military would have just put the country, its people and even her in a precarious situation. She just got some power and trying to implement change after 20 years of house arrest. It would have been stupid of her to not defend the military. But It's always been military with the actual power even with Suu Kyi apparently in charge. I assume they just got tired of working things around her.\n",

The military would still be in power even if he retires but it seems MAH doesn't really want to let go of his power. (mind you, no official source is reporting this yet but this is a very likely possiblity and probably the most plausible) Since in the constitution that they wrote, he had to retire at 65. He turns 65. Suu Kyi probably refused to make MAH president and MAH just said \"fuck it\" kidnapped everyone and took power without a single drop of blood.

      "Comment: Actually, UN is useless. UN need a radical change by split in 2 part. One UN is only member of the real democratic countries and the second UN, the undemocratic countries. If a countries was democratic (like Thailand, Myamar, Russia) but change in dictator ship they go by vote of the member of UN 1 to the second UN. All the decision is made by vote of majority. The result is the democraric countries stay at the minimum of the some number than now  and can only increase. But they could be a war between UN 1 (Europe, Taïwan, South Korea,...) and UN 2 (China, Myamar, Thailand, North Korea,...). By example. UN 2 support the junte of Burma and UN 1 support the democratic group in Burma. UN 2 send blue  troops against the democratic people and UN 1 send blue troop to protect the democratic people. At the end, instead to have civilians non-armed died, it's \"only\" professional military died. To beat one army, only one army can do it. The non-violence never win against an army. It's famous that without Gandhi, the India going to be independant. You can see the Dalaï Lama is just a  waste time. INSTEAD TO HAVE THE STATUS QUO, REFORM UN\n",

Bringing down the Tatmadaw, one way or the other, would need lives, bodies, young people to die for their countries. But instead of fighting, these guys demanded for intervention.

None of these three will be achievable if a certain group of individuals (i.e. the generals) has exclusive access to a power (e.g. heavy weaponry and vehicles).\n",

The entire situation in Myanmar that’s putting Myanmar at the forefront of people’s thoughts around the world is what I’m commenting on.\\n\\nI need to be fast, so I’m going to bullet point this (pun not intended):\\n\\n1) If you really believe (and if there’s evidence to support) that the military is going to start bombing their hundreds of their own countrymen in order to maybe perhaps kill a single protester, then that’s another argument for allowing anyone willing to take up arms.  The military is already escalating against a people that are wholly defenseless.  I’ve seen people telling them to rig up slingshots with rubber gloves and soda bottles and sticks and string to fight back because they’re so desperate.  Holding out hope that evil men will show the defenseless people they’re murdering a bit of good will out of the blue is a fool’s errand.\\n\\n2) Canada’s sanctions on China have no bearing on what’s going on in Myanmar unless you know something I don’t.  I’d love it if you could find me one local that’s praising God that Canada is imposing economic sanctions after finding out their loved ones were murdered, because that would at least show they’re somewhat hopeful during a seemingly hopeless situation.\\n\\n3) To reiterate:  Sure, fighting back will lead to harm, but doing nothing is already leading to harm.  At least if the willing are capable of fighting back, the military will slow their roll and rethink their strategy.  Even evil men want to live to see another day.\\n\\n4) People being defenseless doesn’t mean less violent crime.  Fewer guns means less gun-related deaths and injuries, but it also means the weakest among us are less capable from defending themselves against motivated criminals.  Once you account for crimes in a small handful of densely populated US cities, general violent crime rates plummet substantially.  What’s most notable, though, is that even by the Brady Campaign’s stats (one of the most fervent anti-gun lobby groups in the US), people successfully defend themselves with firearms over 6.5x more often than people are killed in gun-related homicides every year.  Even when you throw in all gun-related deaths — homicides, suicides, accidents, and negligent discharges — the number of successful defense scenarios is still more than 2.5x higher annually.  Firearms give the weakest among us a chance to survive violent crimes should they choose to do so, from the elderly to the physically weak(er), disabled, and mobility impaired.  \\n\\nLike you said, there are evil people all over the world.  And evil people have been maiming, raping, murdering, and imposing tyranny since before firearms were even a concept.  That’s all good reason in favor of allowing anyone that’s willing to be able to defend themselves, their families, and even their country, with the best defensive tools available.  \\n\\nEvil people doing evil things is never a valid argument against self-defense.',\n",

I personally don’t know how it would go for China, would the North Koreans fight with them and invade South Korea? the war with China will almost certainly start over Taiwan imho, which potentially means Japan and South Korea getting involved as well. Chinese expansionism is currently running unchecked and our key allies in the Asian-Pacific are in their sights. we need a strong president right now who realizes that China is our enemy, who takes a hardline against China for the sake of our allies and our nation.
