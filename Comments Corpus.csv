Perhaps some of the Burmese natives can share their voice to the comments.  Although I'm Burmese, I'm unfortunately out of the country since I was 1 and the last I've been in the country is when I was 5.  So I'm a bit out of touch with Burmese internal affairs."

23,"Lambs to a slaughter. Sorry to say. You have evil dictators in power who have no empathy. Your sacrifice will be met with no emotion. It WILL all be in vain. Y'all need to seize their guns and use it against them. You can do it with the numbers. It won't be easy and most of you will die. But it will give the future of your children a chance. Without an uprising, the future will continue to be ruled by your leaders. And right now, they look worse than Chinese, North Korean and Islamic laws. I would give it a try if I had kids and my country was going through it. In fact, it is a duty to the human race to bring down tyrants. If you guys start small and fight smart, you have a much better chance. Plant the seeds of revolution so at least you could build a great army in the ling run. I worry for all you going through this. Good luck and please use your wits."

Move to prevent government for getting tax on my labor.

Go militian with people ( guessing that would get me killed fast)

Or get paid in cypto and pay in cypto.

I wouldnt care if price went up or down. We can have a payout for current rate and if it goes down ill take the lost. If up owner can pocket profit. As long as no money goes to taxes. I am not sure what crytpo would be best for this. Maybe just a stable coin to usd. 

I believe keeping econ going in small terms with people still farming and doimg small jobs while preventing any taxes to go to government will break them. The gangs that make money from collecting taxes cant pay wages if no taxes. The rest of the world needs to make sure all military, government members, and their family cant have money outside myanmar."

51,This is a LOT worse than HK but why people are not paying that much attention???
52,"Pardon me for saying something stupid, but i think your “peaceful protest” are not gonna work.

You need support from military and police (A LOT of them) that willingly support your movement in order to ease your peaceful protest.

Indonesia has same problem in 1998. Suharto’s “New Order” regime (Orde Baru) are behaving the same way like your military and police do (they shot and killed 4 students at May 12, 1998 protest and probably staged mass riot in Jakarta that kill a lot of civvies). 9 day after that incident, Suharto finally resigned after getting pressure from some high ranking military officer that demands his resignation. Thus ending the 32 year “New Order” regime.

If you don’t have support from some military and  police, i’m afraid that armed resistance is the only way to get rid of that regime. Because right now the world clearly doesn’t care about your plight (they’re more care to HK protest than yours)"

92,What a despicable abuse of power
93,Damn it is really horrible. When will the UN take action?
94,This makes me so fucking angry and disgusted that I can't even put it into words. At both the perpetrators for committing these vile acts and myself for being blind to what's happening in the world outside of my bubble. I need to start paying attention and (sry for the language) those cunts can fucking eat shit and die. I can only say that I wish the people of Myanmar the best.
95,Kill all the police.. no pacific protest just violence x violence and revenge.. I hope the three doctors one day will have to cure the cildren of the policemens that hit them and that theu leve them die..
96,Don't use that name for them. It is a colonists term for them invented by the British when they annexed Myanmar in the 80's
97,Monsters. Beating up defenseless compliant citizens who might even need to save their lives at some point. This is like kicking kittens for the hell of it. Absolutely no way to justify this on the police side other than abusing their power on people they consider inferior.

108,"As an Burmese this is really sad

The military show no mercy, even for kids. They shot 3 year olds and 13 year olds. They threw grenades at people and killed hundreds. You could see the dead bodies on Facebook, but I suggest not to. They also killed a doctor for supporting NLD. There’s a rumor that our leader of NLD is on a hunger strike. Our country needs help but the UN isn’t doing shit. 

They are scaring people to not protest but we fought back, not physically. I’ve experienced this before a few weeks ago. The soldiers came to our peaceful neighborhood to create chaos because were too quite. They shot guns on the street. A street dog attack the soldiers and got shot by the soldiers. Thankfully they didn’t come blasting the door down and killing us. Although this happened to many neighborhoods. We were lucky 

This isn’t a cool thing. People are dying for our country and the fighting back. A dad was carrying his dead son and crying and shouting 

My son is dead

He was in tears and the video was recorded.

136,"For the people of Myanmar, agood smoke bomb you can make very easily is this:

2 parts white granulated sugar 

3 parts Potassium Nitrate 

1. Melt the mixture on a low heat until fully combined.
2. Pour into a container of some sort. Popsicle containers make good handheld shapes.
3. Imbed matches tied to a fuse while the mixture is still warm and pliable.

To use, just light the match and fuse until a thick gray smoke is emitted, then throw. 

You can find potassium nitrate really easily in hardware store, also stump remover has high amounts of it in a pinch."

139,"The Communist-influence Military regime in Burma!! “SAY NO TO CRUELEST COMMUNIST-BACKED MYANMAR MILITARY IN THE WORLD”, guys!!"
140,I'm surprised the citizens don't throw glass bottles full of gasoline at the cops.  It doesn't matter how much armored you're wearing if your on fire.  Even a vehicle may suffer serious damage if a snapple bottle full of gasoline shattered on the windshield.  I would imagine the driver might flee a burning vehicle.
141,so sad kids we are gona fight toghter! be strong be alive kids
142,Shit they held that shield wall better than most United States protesters. Police tried to bluff them with discipline and confidence. Didn’t fuckin work out did it.
143,This is the way 🙌
144,If only they had the 2 amendment. It could really help them out in a situation like this.
145,Who fucking cares if they hold the line. What is the difference to the Rohinyga if they are murdered by a military dictatorship or liberal democracy. Why are we concerned with restoring a democratically elected genocidal regime? Those resisting likely aren’t anarchists but complicit in the erasure of an religious and ethnic minority
146,"These people are really lucky that these group of police officers, from the looks of it, have no clue how to use teargas and did not use live ammo. Hopefully it stays that way in Sagaing."
147,They’ve had it rough over there. The ethnic cleansing of the Muslims by the Buddhists is truly appalling.
148,"Are their riot shields.... Half of a large plastic  container?  Oh yeah, when countries don't spend trillions on unnecessary accessories..."
149,"I love how when the soldiers come for them they all talk about fighting back, but during the genocide they happily told the world that the ""others"" werent human. 

Innocent people dying anywhere is a crime but what goes around comes around i guess?"
150,"from what I understand expecting the UN to save you is like expecting your nation's embassy to take up arms, it's maily a podium for political talks, not an actual intitution that wields any power."
151,If you want my honest opinion one of the most effective soft(?) tactics I've seen over the years is getting footage of their personal estates and disseminating it strategically. Drone footage essentially. Think what Navalney did with Putin's Palace.
152,"The UN can only do what states allow it to do. It is the States that have power, not the UN.

The UN Human Rights Council just passed a consensual resolution with much stricter language than any other has ever had. It doesn't mean that it can impose anything: it is not a state and has no army.

What it does mean, is that the Tatmadaw no longer enjoys the same level of support from China it did until the coup. 

And this is a pretty major change on the international side of things."
153,I think u may get a even higher chance of the help from ASEAN? Even Cambodia ended the Khmer Rouge crisis with the help of Vietnam in the 80s. And remember which side did UN support at that time? Sadly it’s Khmer Rouge.
154,"UN cannot be deployed unless the council members of the UNSC gives their approvals. 

Inside this UNSC, both China and Russia are Council members."
155,"The UN is not going to save you.  They didn't stop the genocides in Rwanda or Bosnia, and they won't do anything of substance to stop what's happening to Uighurs in China.

Your destiny is your own.  Organize and resist."
156,"Peace with automatic weapons.  I was in the military, my uncle was a peace keeper in Cyprus in 1960. Is there peace there?   Useless entity.  You don't want to be a peace keeper when your rules of engagement are to look away."
157,"China will never let the UN into Myanmar, unless it's PLA troops in blue helmets only to protect the BRI and other CCP assets. PLA are massing tens if thousands of troops on the border and obviously have other plans for Myanmar and would probably prefer if other countries didn't see what they're about to do."
158,"Best way to deal with the generals is to freeze their assets, once their money starts disappearing, so will they."
159,"China Vetos any human rights and national sovereignty issue that passes the council, They are scum."
160,"The UN is becoming increasingly irrelevant. CCP have hijacked them, just like WTO and WHO. The democracies of the world need to operate by a new mandate. Excluding authoritarian, totalitarian dictatorships such as CCP. For what reason should democratic countries be obligated to respect the vote of corrupt criminal despots such as CCP or other genocidal organisations such as the Myanmar  Junta. The refuse democracy in their countries and yet we let them vote on issues that effect our democracies in the UN."
161,"I think a line in Hotel Rwanda frames it perfectly: We're peace keepers, not peace makers."
162,"In all honesty, the UN was created and only exists to prevent WW3. That was the whole intention of the organization from its founding in 1945 to today. Everything else going on in the world is extra"
163,"As an Israeli, the UN peacekeepers are the most useless thing in this universe. Thise guys will just sit around and do nothing and the second they'll come upon even a small problem they'll run away."
164,"Unless it is  benefitting US, UK or EU, dont expect UN to do jack shit."

170,"the capitalist system protecting its far right fascist friends. Who turn the people in to slaves, That’s a good bit of profit. Don’t give up the fight."
171,Idk the un was made in the after math of ww2 they should have the power and authority to stop things like this from happening
172,"Is this a picture of the Myanmar people during the Rohingya genocide?

When the military was committing genocide against the Rohingya people,  **Aung San Suu Kyi** was silent, and denied it. The people on Myanmar were silent and took no action.

Now YOU are the ones that are being shot and killed. How do you feel now that it is happening to you? Do you wish you had stood up for justice and peace when it was only the Rohingya being murdered? Do you now realize the pain they felt? Can you feel empathy now?

I hope the military Junta are destroyed and sent to jail, but i also hope that the people of Myanmar can self reflect. I hope in the future they can stand up for justice for ALL of Myanmar's people. Because if you don't stand up for one group of people, one day, you will become the group that is being oppressed."
173,I think this was framed on purpose for the movie about the Tutsi genocide in rawanda. I might be wrong but I think it was called hotel rawanda. Kony era stuff.
174,"basically they foster a dialogue, but when it comes to action it's incredibly difficult because of the security council. But that dialogue is important, it inspires leadership all around the world."
175,"Also, just accessing any evidence / video and photo material on the internet right now to create an accurate 'map'. (Also to eventually hopefully prosecute as many responsible people as possible, as sad as it is to think only in terms of future action )"
176,You may want to go and read about the Khmer Rouge - Vietnamese rule period again as your summary of it is fairly skewed. Also UN formed the transitional government UNTAC in the 90s and had no role whatever in supporting Pol Pot and the KR during there swift removal from power by VN
177,"The keystone of ASEAN is a policy of non-interference. Even with the Khmer Rouge, ASEAN refused to do anything because it would create a dangerous precedent for other ASEAN member states to invade or influence each others politics."
178,Maybe help from the CIA would work
179,"My brother visited Rwanda three years ago. The aftermath is Still there. When he took pictures, it was of memorials, and often even bodies that they haven't had time to move yet. When he visited one of the.. bases? For where the UN troops were placed.. he noticed something, that one of the genocide memorials was within 100 yards of it. He checked the times, and yes- the UN was THERE and they were WATCHING. They did nothing."
180,This guy was a UN
181,"They did the same thing during the Rohingya genocide. They just look away. Also Myanmar's people and  Aung San Suu Kyi, they just look away."
182,"I think it's no coincidence they instigated the coup 2 days after the IMF plopped $350 million USD into the central bank of Myanmar for covid relief, the coup leaders then promptly installed an army stooge in as head of the bank. The IMF more or less said they know the money's gone and nothing they can do about it. That 350m will bankroll quite a lot genocidal oppression but freezing assets and cutting off external revenue is still absolutely a good idea"
183,To be fair I believe a lot of products in the fashion industry are made in Burma
184,I know about this actually. The OG one says “uninvolved in Africa” and I believe the photo was taken in Darfur.
185,how?
186,I think you need to do your research a little more about what the Tatmadaw is capable of and why Aung San Suu Kyi's hands were tied during the genocide of the Rohingya people.
187,Preach
188,"The problem is that Rohingya has done the worse against other ethic groups. There are several ethic groups and factions in Myanmar that are against each other. However, one thing they have common is their hatred against Rohingya. After all, they were brought in by British Empire to control other Myanmar people, slaughtered too many others. For the rest of Myanmar people, that genocide was just a payback time."
189,"and it's obviously frustrating to see them not doing anything, it's probably incredibly frustrating for the UN forces who had to basically witness ethnic cleansing and were forbidden to not intervene in different conflicts."
190,"That’s funny. UNTAC was formed in 1992, nearly 20 years after the humanity crisis was already over."
191,"And who holds the seats in UN between 1975 to end of 80s representing Cambodia? Anyway, my point is it’s pretty hopeless if you are waiting for UN support."
192,"Oh so now us action is cool. When the info is public it's like expected but when the information isnt, the US is imperialistic and war seeking. What if this is exactly what was happening in vietnam but no one had cell phones."

196,Thank you foe being honest. The genocide against the Rohingya was pay back. And now karma is paying back the people of Myanmar. Nothing goes unpunished.
197,that was exactly what I thought when I looked at this picture.
198,"They should act on this matter and restore democracy. It's their purpose! 

""Maintain International Peace and Security.

240,"yeah, I agree. But the shouldn't have shot her at all"
241,"Long story short, a fortune teller told the dictator Min Aung Hlaing that he will die by headshot. So he is killing protestors with headshots cos he think it will magically counter his death. Basically, he is a total piece of shit"
242,"There is no such thing as ""shooting somewhere non-fatal.""

When you shoot someone you shoot to kill, that's basic firearms training."
243,May God bless her
244,Shooting someone in the arms or legs may actually be more deadly than say a body shot seeing how bullets bounce around in bodies and is much more likely to hit an artery. The point is no real bullets should hAve been used at all though
245,"I don't know if it fits, but from a video i saw about police being asked ""why don't you shoot the leg or something"" is for 1 you might miss, you already miss most and missing can bring you in danger(though this is unrelated) and 2, anything can easily be fatal. There are arteries basically everywhere and you can hit one with ease, and if you hit a bone and that splinters, good luck

This one however clearly went for the kill"
246,"I’d argue they shouldn’t have shot at all, but your legs are still just as lethal because of major arteries PLUS ricochet. Arms not so much, but once again, ricochet plus it’s a hard shot to even land."
247,"Thats not how guns work...its not cod where you shoot someone in the leg and they take 10 damage. You have major arteries running up your legs and other parts of your body. Shots there are often fatal. Also, it's a lot harder to aim for the legs and arms. Shooting from 10 meters out isn't as easy as you'd think."
248,"Arms or legs is still as fatal as in the body, because we have the main arteries running there. This is a common fallacy, IE: Just shoot him in the legs"
249,"Our ""government"" before this was a quasi-democracy. Although we were on paper ""democratic"", our constitution (written by the military that oppressed us and killed ethnic minorities for decades) always allowed 25% (regardless of votes) of the seats in parliament to the military. Thus, we had a civillian branch (75%) and military branch (25%).

Additionally, the military had it's own political party called USDP which people (extremists right wing supports like Wirathu, basically the Hitler for Rohingyas) could vote for. So this means that the Military (military branch and USDP) had a lot of control when it came to our decisions. They control immigrants and defenses and more, as they were the ones who massacred the Rohingyas. We're fighting now for democracy, meaning to eliminate the 25% (and more) share that the military dogs hold in our country. 

Our government now is the CRPH who are the rightful democratically elected leaders in hiding. They are basically working to represent Myanmar in the UN and so on. The military are the ones who assumed the position of government by force. Their dogs (police and soldiers alike) are the ones who killed the Rohingyas and and the ones who are killing us now."

Realistic views is this, no country is keen to send military into Myanmar firstly due to the reason that by doing so, any other country would be empowered to do so in their area of influence like China and Russia. China could use this example and invade its neighbours as it pleases for this one example. 

Myanmar does not have oil and thus America other than voicing concerns, putting tariffs and calling support only verbal talks in the end will still recognise the Junta. No other nation can provide help if even America is not going to do anything beyond symbolic. 

My country have started withdrawing and freezing investments into Myanmar in a bid to help out by using our soft power influence. As a small nation we cannot provide Myanmar anything further other than our prayers and soft powers by using finance.

무슨일이 일어 났고, 왜 일어 났는가?

2021년 2월 1일, 민 아웅 훌라잉 사령관이 이끄는 미얀마 군이 쿠데타를 일으켰고, 민주적으로 선출된 정부를 전복하였습니다. 1962년부터 2011년까지 수십년동안 잔혹한 군부독재 치하에 있던 국가로써, 그들이 과거에 인종청소와 전쟁범죄 등 수많은 야만적인 범죄를 저질러 왔음은 분명한 사실입니다. 악명높은 쿠데타 괴수인 민 아웅 훌라잉은 소수민족에 대한 조직적인 차별과 인권유린에서부터 로힝야인 인종청소까지 수많은 범죄행위로 잘 알려져 있으며, 그로 인해 국제적인 비난과 제재를 받고 있습니다.
쿠테타와 시민들이 민주적으로 선출한 몇몇 공직자에 대한 구금이 발생한 후, 미얀마 시민들은 전국가적이고 비폭력 저항운동을 시작하고, 시민 불복종 운동(CDM)에 참여하였습니다. 그러나, 무장군인들은 비폭력 저항운동가들과 불복종 운동 참여자들에게 실탄과 방화, 불법연행과 결국 죽음으로 몰아가는 상상할 수 없는 고문으로 무자비하게 대했습니다. 다시 언급하기 싫지만, 비인간적인 무장 군인들에 의해 저질러진 혐오스러운 예를 몇가지 들자면:
- 집에 숨어들은 비폭력 운동가들을 도운 임산부의 머리에 대고 총을 쏘았음.
- 거리에서 부상자를 구하려는 의학도생을 죽임.
- 활동가를 납치하고, 산이나 뜨거운 물을 입속에 붓는 고문으로 죽음에 이르게 함.
- 총으로 쏘아 죽인 19세 운동가의 무덤을 경찰들이 비밀리에 파헤침.

이 글을 쓰는 지금까지 200명 이상이 살해 당했으며, 수천의 시민들이 불법적으로 감금되었습니다. 자유를 향한 싸움에 떨어진 꽃잎들은 정치인들, 의사들, 승려들, 임산부와 어린이들만이 아닙니다.
군인들의 잔혹성은 매일매일 계속 증가하고 있고, 이 극악한 범죄들은 멈추어져야 합니다.  이런 환경에도 불구하고, 미얀마의 국민들은 그들의 권리와 자유를 위한 싸움을 계속할 것입니다.

이 혁명에 참여하고 도움을 주시려면:

- 시민들과 공무원들이 그들의 직업과 수입을 희생해 가면서 이 싸움에 참여하고 있습니다. 거기에, 많은 방화, 파괴와 다른 폭력행위로 인해, 많은 사람들이 집을 잃거나, 혹은 안전한 장소로 옮기느라 집을 포기해야 했습니다. 기본적인 경제적 결핍에 대해 미얀마 국민들을 직접적으로 지원할 수 있는Mutual Aid Myanmar를 방문해 주세요. 또한 군부독재와 싸우는 임시 정부인 CRPH의 기금에 기부함으로써 지원을 해 주실 수도 있습니다.
- 지금의 이 싸움을 도와주시고 싶은 분들은, 사시는 곳에서 비폭력 운동을 조직해 주십시요.조직을 만들기 전에 당국에 먼저 확인해 주십시요.
- 당신을 대표하는 기관이나 국회의원들에게 편지, 이메일 혹은 전화를 통해, 현 미얀마의 상태에 대해 병력지원, 표적 제재 혹은 다른 종류의 가능한 지원 방법들과 같은 도움을 보내는 것에 대해 지지하는 입장을 밝혀 주시는 것도 도움이 됩니다.
- 미얀마의 현 상황에 대해 인지도를 높이는 것으로 도움을 주실 수도 있습니다. 친구들, 가족과 이웃들에게 뉴스들을 퍼뜨려 주십시요. SNS에 공유해 주시고, 그때 아래의 해시태그를 포함하도록 해 주십시요.:

단지 이 게시글을 읽고, 미얀마의 상황에 관심을 기울여 주신 것만으로도 당신은 이미 미얀마 국민들에게 도움을 준 것입니다. 이미 당신은 미얀마의 모든 시민들을 돕고, 자유와 정의를 위해 싸우는 혁명의 참여자임을 기억해 주십시요. 이 싸움은 종교와 인종에 상관없이 모든 이에게 평등한 권리와 기회를 주는 밝은 미래를 위한 싸움입니다.

#Comment aider le peuple du Myanmar dans son combat pour la liberté si vous êtes dans un autre pays?

# Que s'est-il passé et pourquoi ?

Le 1er février 2021, les militaires du Myanmar, dirigés par le commandant en chef Min Aung Hlaing, ont organisé un coup d'État et renversé avec succès le gouvernement démocratiquement élu. Le Myanmar a été soumis à une dictature militaire sévère pendant cinq décennies, de 1962 à 2011. La brutalité et les nombreux crimes commis par les militaires, notamment des génocides et des crimes de guerre, sont évidents dans son histoire. Le tristement célèbre chef du coup d'État, Min Aung Hlaing, est connu pour une multitude de crimes allant de la discrimination systémique et des violations des droits de l'homme à l'encontre des groupes minoritaires au nettoyage ethnique contre le peuple Rohingya, pour lesquels il a fait l'objet d'une condamnation et de sanctions internationales.

Après le coup d'État et la détention de plusieurs responsables démocratiquement élus par la population civile, les citoyens du Myanmar ont commencé à manifester pacifiquement dans tout le pays et ont participé au Mouvement de désobéissance civile (CDM). Cependant, les forces armées ont impitoyablement traité les manifestants pacifiques et les participants au CDM à l'aide de balles réelles, d'incendies criminels, d'enlèvements et de méthodes de torture impensables qui ont fini par entraîner des morts tragiques. Aussi déprimant que cela puisse être, il convient de donner quelques exemples de l'abomination perpétrée par les forces armées inhumaines :

• Une femme enceinte a été abattue d'une balle à bout portant dans la tête pour avoir aidé des manifestants pacifiques à se cacher dans sa maison

• Un étudiant en médecine a été tué pour avoir tenté de sauver des blessés dans une rue de la ville

• Un militant a été enlevé et torturé à mort en lui versant de l'acide ou un liquide extrêmement chaud dans la bouche et en l'éventrant.

• La police a secrètement déterré la tombe d'un manifestant de 19 ans tué par balle, ce qui a provoqué une nouvelle vague d'indignation et suscité des soupçons de dissimulation.

Plus de 200 personnes ont été tuées au moment où nous écrivons ces lignes et des milliers de civils ont été détenus illégalement. Les héros qui ont donné leur vie en luttant pour la liberté sont, entre autres, des hommes politiques, des médecins, des moines, des femmes enceintes et des enfants.

Les atrocités commises par les militaires augmentent de jour en jour et ces crimes d'une sauvagerie extrême doivent cesser. Malgré ces circonstances, le peuple du Myanmar continue de défendre ses droits et sa liberté. Le sacrifice des héros tombés au combat ne doit pas être vain.

(Edit : cela ne fait pas partie de l'article original, mais j'ai trouvé une liste assez complète des crimes de Tatmadaw et des preuves - c'est en anglais, cependant. [La situation au Myanmar] (https://www.myanmarspringrevolution.org/crimes.html))

#Comment vous pouvez aider et faire partie de cette révolution:

Les fonctionnaires et les civils ont participé à la grève en sacrifiant leurs emplois et leurs revenus. En outre, en raison des nombreux incendies criminels, actes de vandalisme et autres actes de violence, certaines personnes ont perdu leur maison ou ont dû l'abandonner pour se déplacer vers des lieux plus sûrs. Visitez le site Mutual Aid Myanmar pour aider la population du Myanmar en répondant directement à ses besoins économiques de base. Vous pouvez également contribuer à la collecte de fonds organisée par le CRPH, le gouvernement démocratique parallèle qui tente de vaincre la junte militaire.

Si vous tenez absolument à participer à ce combat, vous pouvez organiser des manifestations pacifiques là où vous vivez. Veuillez vérifier auprès des autorités locales avant d'en organiser une.
Il est également utile de contacter votre représentant ou votre membre du Congrès par lettre, courriel ou appel téléphonique pour lui faire part de votre position sur la situation au Myanmar et de votre approbation pour l'envoi de toute forme d'aide, qu'il s'agisse d'une aide militaire, de sanctions ciblées ou de toute autre méthode de soutien viable.

Vous pouvez également aider en sensibilisant simplement les gens à la situation actuelle au Myanmar. Alors, s'il vous plaît, diffusez la nouvelle à vos amis, votre famille et vos voisins. Partagez-la sur les plateformes de médias sociaux et veillez à inclure les hashtags suivants :

• #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar

Vous avez déjà aidé le peuple du Myanmar rien qu'en lisant ce post et en vous intéressant à la situation du Myanmar. N'oubliez pas que vous aidez tous les citoyens du Myanmar et que vous faites déjà partie de cette révolution qui se bat pour la liberté et la justice.

290,"Hello everyone, I had an idea of something we (as in people outside Myanmar) can do to show support. Not sure if it's a good idea or if it's even feasible, but I just wanted to comment on it and see what other people think. 

Basically, what if all of us, people from all around the world, record a really short video showing support for the people of Myanmar (like just a few seconds) and then we get someone to edit all the short clips together, and then find a way to send it online to people in Myanmar. I kind of think this would all be feasible given the power of these online networks. 

I know it's not like this would change anything concretely, but I think the people in Myanmar probably feel so alone in this fight against the military, and maybe something like this would give them a boost in morale, knowing that people all over the world are watching an supporting them. It would show them that what they are doing has a positive impact far beyond Myanmar and that people are listing to them.

My heart breaks because I have friends from Myanmar that I used to play online with, they’re reaaally nice people! and I haven’t heard from them in days. 🥺 I hope this is over soon and once it’s over I hope I hear from them again or at least see them online again."
311,"During the Rohingya issue, I was in MM and they bullied me because Malala raised the issue and they hated my guts for being a Muslim. They told me in the office where I worked that it was their internal affair - now that the Marshallaw is implemented it isn't an internal affair?

And if you are so much so on a destructive path there are more options:

&#x200B;

1. Self Destruct
2. Pick up arms
3. Atleast fix the divide that you have within. You guys are pretty racist

Handle it like it is your internal affair. I have seen trends against Asean and when it works for you the tea alliance shit comes up."
312,To anyone else who doesn’t really know much about this here’s [a handy list I found](https://www.myanmarspringrevolution.org/crimes.html)
313,Damn
314,"I know I'm late, and this may be off topic (if so sorry), but are the images graphic? I'm talking about the grave digging and torture ones. I have a weak stomach when it comes to graphic images.
(I'm sorry if I used wrong words in the wrong places.)"
315,CPRH GoFundMe is suspended by the way.
316,If they want it I happen to have a book on how to make dangerous things.
317,"First of all, I want to tell all the Burmese people affected by the war that the war can not be solved by demonstrations and protests, so what you should do now is to protect yourself and not participate in other things because you don't have the ability to wait until it is over. The only help I can do. I don’t need to take photos, videos, and send them to all mankind who look bad now. It doesn’t make sense to call on relevant departments to take care of this kind of nonsense. I don’t think there is much to say unless the number of people in the Red Cross is correct. The firepower is stronger than the army... Or shut up is the best choice for all of you. Every soldier knows that fighting is not good flop"
318,"The people of Myanmar are incredibly strong and brave, fighting against the military’s heavy brutality and barbarism. All of those suffering are in my deepest prayers and thoughts"
319,"Rent a boeing 747 and 15 escort planes, fly it over the Rangoon and drop 5000 grenades and 10,000 guns and endless boxes of armor piercing ammunition, helmets and body armor, so that the people and the army are on equal grounds... Write to your chinese business partners and friends and say China has an ancient history but CC.C.P is happy to encourage it's neighbor Myanmar to shoot 500 civilians in the back to suppress civilian associations, while putting handcuffs in the mouth of it's most successful and intelligent businessman, jack Ma, so that people like him can have no power over the socialist freedoms of their region of the world."
320,"Same way you Treated the Rohingya. Remember the Genocide you were  and still are causing against your own Burmese minority   ! I cry for them and supported Su Kyi , But all of you remained silent as their villages were burned down , women raped and children slaughtered  under the Buddhist Banner . Despicable and Shameful !"
321,Does Myanmar have something similar to the 2nd Amendment?
322,"Relentless pressure on your governments. Its the only 'legal' way. 

Another is lots of 'freedom fighters' joining the cause."
323,"беларусы оказались в такой же ситуации, только там смертей меньше. более 30000 арестованных"
324,"хочу посоветовать посмотреть на ютубе материал как украинцы боролись с такими "" украина майдан 2013- 2014"" там можно почерпнуть медоды борьбы на улице, а также связаться в телеграмме"" кабинет представителей светланы тихоновской"" по вопросам экономической борьбы"
325,im the save people
326,Did the ruling party commit election fraud?
327,STOP WHAT UR DOING MILITARY PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
328,"ALSO THE MYAMMER PEOPLE KILLED ATLEAST 7 MILITARY IF I

 AM CORRECT"
329,I'm from Myanmar
330,What about the EU? We are there for you!
331,Can anyone update this post? The number of deaths has increased significantly. Maybe add the news about the person who was burned alive as an example of another inhuman act.

334,If reddit could almost crash the stock market i think we can do it to the military
335,"I just saw news reports from Al Jazeera and DW (German international news). If you have any local English news, I would like to follow along, please DM, reply with links. Best of luck guys!"
336,I'm  Myanmar and I'm about to move somewhere to study in 2022. What should I do now?
337,".Let me give you a quick recap of our country's history. The military had control over the country for nearly 30 years in the past, (started off by killing most important generals, straight up gunning down protestors including a couple thousands of students and monks, creating corruption beyond measure, and selling away all the country resources for their own good, letting ppl starve under a dictatorship ).  But since the democratic party won the election in 2015 with a landslide victory, they lost their previous authority/ways get corrupted money. The last 5 years has been quite stable in the country except for the Rohingya crisis that was also carried out by the same murderers from the military. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi went out there at the ICJ for the face and name of the fellow Burmese citizens,(didn't have the power to do anything other than that). Fast forward to the coup happening... 2020 elections saw the most votes for the democratic party in history. Just as the citizens were hoping of erasing their bs laws they had set out during their rule, the military seized all the members who are in charge right in the middle of a parliament meeting. (reasoning that there was fraud in the votes and they had to do the right thing!!) They also staged instability/protests in the country to find a proper reason for an emergency takeover. (also cutting off all networks and phone lines). Most of the democratic leaders and political speakers are now detained and sent to jail for really absurd reasons like( owning a walkie-talkie: how Daw Su was framed, breaking covid safety rules: how our president was framed, and sometimes for no reason). Now they are threatening us with the weapons that we; civilians bought through taxes. The military has a good relationship with China and is ready to illegally sell all of the country's resources once again to get all the money they can for themselves. Now, this may sound highly biased but all of them are certainly true- you can ask Burmese ppl, I doubt that it would be any different.

I am sorry for my English(it is not my mother tongue)"

339,"I can not do much but the little I can do I will. I will share this. Also, DM me if you would like to communicate when internet platforms are removed from your use."

341,hey bruv or someone spread this to r/worldnews or twitter or some social media
342,"Is this being covered up on Reddit or what? Pro-military bots downvoting everything to oblivion? 

I've had to come to this sub directly because I've seen so little news about it elsewhere, and it should have been at the top of /r/all for the past 2 days. What is going on? I'm not religious so I'll just hope for the best of luck for everyone there. I will try and help in any way I can from across the world. You can get through this. Be safe"
343,This needs more upvote
344,This is a chance for the people of Myanmar to show their strength and rise up against the evil Tatmadaw. It's time to make one final push to reach true democracy.

357,What's Myanmar government's main income? Where does their money come from? Can someone help me track the money source?

364,Can we please.
365,"I dunno, the stock market just has some rich assholes crying because they’re seeing red on their phone while sitting on their golden toilets. The Myanmar military have guns. 

I’m not saying we can’t do it, I’m sure we can make an impact by spreading the word here, but I think these are two incredibly different fights to pick."
366,"Assuming you could get millions of redditors to feel passionately for your side, what would your next step be?"
367,"I mean... ok but how? The situation has nothing to do with stock market. We can ask international officials to Boycott military myanmar until there is a new democracy but that will put the country into an economical crisis. 
Idrk tbh ...."
368,"Instructions unclear. Are we supposed to be bringing down a military dictatorship, cause I have a clan raid in an hour."
369,What's Myanmar government main income?
370,"True, duh!"

372,We must unite and stay alert.

379,We citizens are so depressed now . Hope the world help us 🙏
380,The UN was going to help when Myanmar's military was committing genocide but met resistence from the government. This is karma.
381,If you think why many people hate India remember too look at your comment and you know
382,😢 I can't imagine how bad it must be over there for them 😢 people whinge about the UK but if they opened their eyes they'd realise how lucky we actually are. I hope this whole saga comes to an end soon for everyone involved and all those responsible are held accountable 🤬
383,"Holy motherfucker, people go into these protests knowing they are likely to die"
384,Her name was Angle. 19 years old girl RIP
385,All countries and UN not only condemn the Myanmar military. Pls take action to save the poor and brave Myanmar people.

395,This is not Angel’s.
396,If the outcome is death regardless of whether if it's peaceful protest or violent protest...should there be more violent protests?
397,"I'm not saying that, what I'm saying is that in comparison we have it easy over here. I'm not saying don't fight for what's right, but I hear an awful lot of people whinge about the daftest of things."
398,Y'all don't have guns either do you?
399,U should do too.
400,I think she is okay so far. Haven’t heard any news with that name.
401,"The outcome between peaceful and violent protests are double digit body counts per day vs quadruple digit body counts. We front liners are not going to use violence, none of us have it in us to kill. History has shown that the moment we start using violence, thousands will die per day, with the excuse of ""protecting stability""."
402,"Oh you're totally right that people whinge over the stupidest things, but that's intentional. Before Tucker Carlson was even famous he said  “when you look out across the moat every day at the hungry peasants in the village, you don’t wanna stoke envy among the proletariat.”

How do they do that? By making us whinge and fight each other"
403,"We do, but they're heavily regulated and controlled, the only time people can use them is for hunting or practice on a range which I totally agree with. I enjoy playing with guns but don't think every Tom dick and Harry should own one as I think the general public can be extremely irresponsible with them."
404,I guess you're right. It's not like the US where you can violently protest and get away with it after all.
405,"Well the military (your people) have no problem with that it seem.  If you want your country back, hundred of thousand if not millions of your people must die to overthrown this government once and for all.  Otherwise your country is lost forever.  Take it from me, a Vietnamese who would sacrifice his life for his country.  If I could die so that the Vietnam Communist Party (VCP) is gone from Vietnam forever, I would.  Nothing I want more than for my people to live under democracy."
406,"Very true, I'm quite easy going to be honest. I try not to get involved in politics and try my best not to judge people, I just want what's best for people, just so long as they don't do me wrong then I'm happy. I do worry about the way the country is going sometimes but I always try to put things into perspective and try to have faith in our system, it can be hard at times but I can only control what my reaction is towards it."
407,Sadly...the list goes on... it’s more than 20 rn
408,How can someone do this to their own nation...
409,They are killing kids! This is despicable
410,Rest in peace :(
411,"Rest in peace, heroes"
412,"Don’t mean to be disrespectful, just wondering what is going on in Myanmar? I haven’t heard of this."
413,"Fuck this shit. This is totally not fair.

Reddit do your shit and make your US government do something"
414,Murdering children now. They are animals and must be held responsible.
415,May they rest in peace
416,Let's hope what you were fighting for is achieved. R.I.P.
417,It breaks my heart. I'm 38 years old and these are kids. Just kids barely breaking out into the real world....there is no justice in this world.
418,We have got to overthrow this fucked up governments
419,"Rest in peace, may the loss not be in vain."
420,God rest their souls.
421,Fuck Min Aung Hlaing and his bootlickers. Bastards have been murdering children since 1988. Same old disgusting movie with a different cast.
422,"I think it is insane how many died because of headshots like they are not trying to slow down or Injure someone no they go straight for the kill most of the time it looks to me.

Stay safe out there!"
423,Bad karma for the terrorists and their evil dogs.
424,Yanno what. I hope karma comes back and bites the mf's in the ass
425,People will fight once they realized that their lives are in danger even though they haven't done anything wrong.
426,Than you for standing up for what you believe in
427,This was very hard to get through :/ they were *so* young.. my heart breaks for all of my brothers and sisters there in Myanmar.
428,Goddamn.  So many young people.  May they rest in peace.
429,Damn. They killing kids.
430,I wish they'd let American civilians in as I see it if all the freedom fighters went over there we'd have yall free in no time I ain't scared to help a nation in need if its for the good of their people. But that could cause a bigger problem with allied nations. Wish there were things we could do.
431,We will stand with Myanmar till the end.

When the dust is settled, the people who started this will face justice and beg for forgiveness; Make sure we remember the lives lost, so they don't receive it."
434,"Donating and spreading awareness the best I can. Stay strong Myanmar, those were the sons and daughters of a democracy and that is an unforgivable crime. 

My heart is breaking for you guys."
435,"So many young people killed by a shot to the head, how can this be called anything but murder?"

Are you afraid to die like the teenagers and muslims who fight for Myanmar?? You are not the real leader as far as current generation do!! You’re just bunch of cowards who hide and afraid of your own soul, BS leader!! My ass!!"

476,"I am trying to say, ""The Universe"" is going to give you guys an assist."
477,This post makes too much sense.  No one will comment.
478,Ignorant westerner came here to say thank you for your explanation.
479,"Indian here, thanks for an actual explanation. A lot many do not understand the situation (like me, I admit) but keep giving judgements. I really wish you guys stay safe. I have joined this sub to stay updated."
480,Such a good explanation. This guy needs to be under every post about recent Burmese news.
481,"U Ko Ni (Burmese Muslim and legal advisor to DASSK)

He was credited with finding loopholes in the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar and in particular with creating the office of state counsellor, which enabled Aung San Suu Kyi to become the de facto head of government in 2016.[6] He advocated constitutional change in Myanmar,[7] believing that the 2008 Constitution, which was drafted by the military, should be replaced and not merely amended.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Ni"
482,Spot on. This is the truth.
483,"And f7ck the peo0le saying NLD probably cheated in Election. 
They are virtually everyone's choice to vote except for the junta fucks. 

Also no we dont expect World Police to do shit. Also fuck your sanctions."
484,Good luck buddy :(
485,"Thank you, I am from the uk living in Yangon and this explains a lot"
486,"Fun little info---- The military handed out tiny anti Muslim propaganda books to some schools. They contain descriptions of how women who were married to or converted to  Islam were abused by the Muslim families(BeatenRaped,Killed,etc). And also spread anti-muslim news on Facebook (most used social media).And national media controlled by the military downplayed the whole crisis keeping most everyday people in the dark.

This all happened after Suu Kyi's party won the election. The military planted many seeds to cause instability to regain control.

I got one of those little books but I lost it.. probably tossed it because it smelled like propaganda.

If I found it I'll upload some images.."
487,"Western media and ""Trendtivist"" got played by military regarding Rohingya issue like a fiddle.

Military learn from the best in terms of coup, propaganda, brainwashing, creating division, ethnic cleansing and creating fake news from China and Russia.

It also helps that Military have unlimited funds stolen from Myanmar people to hire and dress convicts, uneducated and poor people, junior army men to dress up as both sides to create violence unrest and do their law and order narrative.

Now the west get to watch in horror as all the ethnic minorities like Shan, Kayin and Rakhine including Rohingya and many others are going to be slaughter like back in the Asshole Than Shwe days. There won't be a single journalist to cover the next massacre."
488,Can u link original topic?
489,Yes.
490,"I’m also from Myanmar and I can confirm this.
Thanks for great explanation."
491,"News here have clearly reported what you clearly just wrote. Aung Kyi, while wining in a landslide, had no real power bc of the military and the military was 100% responsible for the violence towards Muslims and not accepting the recent elections. 

\- American (a sad American)"

494,"If I may ask, what she had done for Rohingya? Had she ever try to defuse the Buddhist religious leaders fanning the hate messages on Muslim? 

Surely she had done something. I really looking forward to some answer. I used to live in Myanmar and I asked about this once but get no answer. I guess it is not a comfortable topic to discuss with."
495,Can you explain the difference between responsible and complicit?
496,Brilliant!
497,I saw some people commenting on facebook things like save my country so i rushed to find explanation here and thank you for providing. I really hope your country will see better and happier days soon.
498,Western people have culturally been programmed to believe that any governance of other countries is far inferior to them and the result is that they often miss the point when applying their worldview to what happen in country like myanmar.
499,Please pin this!
500,"Furthermore there is an ongoing love affair among western liberal institutions to go around searching constantly for injustices against muslims around the world to fit their bizarre and whacky narrative that is peddled to them at universities day and night. Nobody really knows why this is the case, but in the case of Myanmar, every activist nosering campus dyke and spinster will rush to the aid of the rohingya without even realizing there are 300 or more minority groups in our country who likewise need help and suffer under the despotic shitty and incompetent military elite, not to mention bamar people themselves."
501,"Thanks for the explanation. It's hard to believe that the leader of the country from 2016 to 2021 had no power to stop or condemn the military actions. The military is completely fucked then.

 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/8/rohingya-report

>**In 2017, a brutal military crackdown forced some 750,000 Rohingya to flee across the border into Bangladesh in violence that is now the subject of genocide charges against Myanmar at the United Nations’ top court**. Of the more than 250,000 Rohingya left in Myanmar, at least 100,000 have been living in refugee camps having been displaced during an earlier wave of violence in 2012."
502,"“...the coup would have come sooner.”

So you kicked the can down the road while you watched the Rohingya get slaughtered?"
503,EXACTLY. People like them are so easy to judge.
504,If there was people blaming the leader for genocide that’s not because of western press they’re just idiots lol. I really don’t like our media complex but the first headline I saw explained it was the military trying to steal power from the elected leader.
505,"This post explains everything so well, I can't count the amount of people I have to deal with that blame ASSK for this."
506,"Thanks for the post - and I did search out Ko Ni. Fascinating, yet brutally tragic story."
507,The world needs to see this
508,"Yeah stop lying, we all saw the videos of Myanmar streets parading and being happy that muslims got raped and burned. The vids are online where you poke sticks in their bodys and laugh. 

You didn't seem to feel the need to protest when they got killed but now that same evil is killing you poeple you are shocked?"
509,"Sorry to burst your bubble but the UN fact-finding mission's [report](https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/myanmarFFM/Pages/ReportoftheMyanmarFFM.aspx) describes in detail how the NLD government not only supported the Tatmadaw's war crimes in Rakhine but also razed villages and took other steps to ensure Rohingya would never be able to return.

ASSK is complicit at the very least. There was also no need for her to lead Myanmar's defense team at the ICJ, but she did."

Please explain exactly who is who and what is going on. Other wise yes I’ll just go back to my cozy home and go to sleep cuz this doesn’t make any sense
519,"I will certainly comment. Because I have got hammered on Twitter for saying just the above. And I am not speaking as an arm chair commentator or even a Burmese but as one who has background in International relations and worked on the ground in Asia.

Don’t get me wrong I found the deeds of the military junta horrendous and hope for a speedy restore of democracy. But it just doesn’t make sense for China to involve in regime change and install a unfriendly government. I’d like you to share the info I didn’t know.
559,cia's publicity
560,Why jail when we can pubicly humiliate and torture them for the countless crimes and atrocities they have commited.
561,Explain?
562,"""Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"", his own philosophy, was unanimously voted into the chinese constitution back in 2017. It's said he's on par with the level of power that Mao had."
563,"Not harsh at all. With their own share of concentration camps for the Uyghurs, he's exactly just that. They just have the economic power to prevent foreign intervention."
564,"The comparison is literally dead on. China is basically 1930s Germany, all the way down to the west turning a blind eye to their imperialism and atrocities."

579,How strong are those shields?
580,Nice. We just need to start kicking the military fuckwits Sparta style.
581,"Honest advice...tighten the shield wall, especially in the middle.  What made the Roman shield walls so effective was how tight they were.  Plus, overlap will help some areas be better protected against small arms fire.  Also, if you want I would suggest practicing moving as one whole unit.  That will give you protection whilst being mobile.  A chant or some form of rhythmic grunting/noise can help keep everyone in sync.  Moving a shield wall like that as one whole group will require that as a metronome of sorts. 

I'd love to hear from anyone with better experience on how you can outfit their shields against bullets and not weigh them down."
582,SHIELD WALL!!!
583,"Glad to know this one ,but all of you guys need to stay alert and be safe from the terrorists in Burma. The Military is becoming the worst. They are busy shooting at protestors and national TV channels are broadcasting fake news. China and Russia are aiding the terrorists in Burma to become our nation like their ones. Just need to restore Democracy in Burma. No more Terrorism and Dictatorship around the world. Dictatorship must fade away from each nation in the world. Truth finally wins eventually. Hoping we win in the end. Salute to all martyrs who have cost their lives in Democracy Revolution and guys in front of us to prevent from the attacks."
584,"Stay safe, stay anonymous, stay together, and record EVERYTHING. Wear goggles and anything helmeted to protect from hitting your head on the ground. 

You guys know about the road pylon trick for tear gas? Smother with water as well.

Use ONLY water, removing clothing and eye contacts, wash with water, cough, remove mucus from lungs and nose. 
Tear gas is a powder, pepper spray is different. Still wash with water"

592,"To all the people saying it won't matter when the bullets start, let me remind you that this is still a hell of a lot better than their bare clothes and flesh. If those shields even slightly slow down a bullet, it could mean the difference between life and death."
593,"Jesus, the fact that they need to is horrible. I was in Myanmar in 2016, just around the time of the first real democratic elections in the country in a long time (maybe ever? I can't remember), and everyone was so happy about it. It's so sad seeing the military taking over the country all over again. Good luck, and keep fighting! I sincerely hope you guys can make a difference<3"
594,We need to fight back. Beat them up giving some hard lessons when you isolate some fucking polices before let them go.
595,God bless! Take the power back! Power to the people!
596,"My father used to supply the Karen people with weapons and ammunition machines that let them reuse their ammunition. The military won't stop, they will keep killing until they achieved their goals and if necessary abolish democracy forever. You need to arm yourself, build groups, do guerilla like warfare. Destroy their equipment, go in the night and ambush their artillery and leave again, do this all the time, this will make the military withdraw as their equipment is vital for their success. Go military yourself in small groups, while keeping up the peaceful protests, but destroy their morality at night. Wound soldiers from afar with slingshots so their morale gets destroyed and so on.
Anyways I hope your protests will actually do something.
Try to fuck up nampong airforce base.

I don't know, it's time to pull out the beast in you, to form actual para military groups and do something vicious and morality destroying"
597,[deleted]
598,Try making these bulletproof.  There are several ways this can be done.  There are everyday materials that can work as bulletproof.  This includes pure wool felt and silk.
599,Really very stupid. The protestors shouldn't be letting the military get that close. The tin shields will provide ZERO protection from a bullet  of any calibre. People will die doing this.
600,Yall better have spears as well.
601,"Not a strategist or anything, so take whatever said with a grain of salt.

Wouldn't those shield be worse? When a bullet hits one, the metal ripped apart and sends metal scraps towards the shield holder. If the military or police uses a shotgun, that's even worse because now you have metal shards along with it. 

It'll work on polices without guns, but I'm not sure if it's better if they have guns. 

What they need to do is not to fight head on. It's hard to win head on if you don't have guns and your enemies have way superior weapons. Brute forcing would result in a lot of death.

The alternative way would be to use guerrilla tactics, It doesn't matter if the tactics is petty either. You fighting a military dictatorship, use everything in your power to achieve your goal.

They need to use some kind of pepper-spray projectiles, even if it's primitive. Pepper powder should be accessible. (I don't know if this would work but maybe pepper powder covered in cloth? so when thrown it sort of explodes?)

For range, perhaps a slingshot or a sling could help. Mix that with some kind of pepper projectiles and hurl them towards the enemy.

Bows would work, but are difficult to make. Especially the arrow part as I assume that only arrows with a metal head could pierce modern armor vest.

Avoiding direct combat is probably the best choice as well, or there will be too much casualties. 

The other way would be to use cruel tactics. Somehow poison the polices or military water and food supply, use loud speakers (if you get one) and play loud gun firing sounds at nights to keep them mentally drained, and etc."

The fact that they have to take on corruption with tin shields speaks volumes."

The fundings will be used in formation of Federal Army , supporting CDM and other urgent necessities to be carried out for country’s reconstruction.  
 Kindly circulate this towards your friends and friends of friends in order to help us get the fundings as well as the awareness about the current situation in Myanmar."
698,The US is NOT getting involved in this. Don't rely on a foreign country to come in and save Myanmar because it won't happen.
699,"This is basically a Chinese invasion of Myanmar using the Tatmadaw to do the dirty work. Now it's time to see what the Quad, 5 Eyes and EU are really made of. Exactly how many countries are they prepared to let CCP invade before they take some serious action. There are a coalition of 10 ethnic armies in Myanmar waiting for the west to send supplies and support them with airstrikes. China is basically invading the world and have met no serious opposition. The world is going to have to declare war on China sooner or later or face being CCP slaves for the next 1000 years."
700,pray for Myanmar
701,"Damn, I wish y'all had the 2nd amendment 😞"

They have put very little back in to empowering the region whilst still regurgitating the same old ""exploitative westerner"" rhetoric.

801,"I bet Generals are proud of this because it makes them look good as efficient murders. What in the world murdering civilians aka its own citizens, enjoying festivities as a logical military operation. This is a blatant crime against humanity and they are not giving a fu●k cuz they kept getting away with it."
802,"This really needs a stop. This is not something a person with intellect would do… 

How many more lives are needed for the international communities to give aid to those in dire needs? And, how come the people causing these deeds don’t realise the severe consequenses that they will be facing afterwards at some point? 

Every action has a counter reaction."
803,"The works of those who claim to ""protect the nation, the race, the culture, and the religion"".

This picture is tragic. So many of them look like children.. 

I know very little about what's happening in Myanmar right now besides the fact that the army took control and there is now a civil war in some regions. Can anybody explain a little bit more what the situation is like? Is the fighting restricted to specific regions only? Does the new military 'government' have much support at all (I hope not after seeing these pictures..)."
822,"Don't get me wrong , I'm genuinely sad that this is happening. Bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructure doesn't count for a war crime under the doctrine of military necessity . Further what makes it worse is the fact that war crimes come under public international law which doesn't deal with insurgencies or civil wars broadly , unless the said country gets chopped into 2 or more or gets occupied ."
823,They look like they were alive enough to attempt to crawl away from the fire
824,a lot of these images are of young children too…this is so fucked up
825,Why on earth did this happen omg?
826,When did this happen?
827,"For those who thinks this was an accident, IT IS NOT. The military knows what they are doing and they do this every time they lose a battle against PDF or ethnic armed forces. Basically, they want to imply that, ""If you kill us, we'll kill the civilians."" As someone who was born and raised in Myanmar and currently still living in this country, it pains my heart to see this every single day and angry at myself for not being able to do anything to help my country."
828,"This is so heartbreaking to see. May everyone who involved in all these war crimes suffer in Hell for an eternity.

Forgive me if I sound stupid. But at this point of war, shouldn't we have air raid shelters everywhere and an alarm system for incoming air raids or something? Are those expensive or hard to build or are just ineffective? Then what is a better solution to prevent tragedies like this from happening  in the future? Please enlighten me guys."

894,"If the west stands by any longer, like they did with the genocide of Rohingya and Xinjiang and Tibet they are sending the CCP and Tatmadaw a very clear message. They have faced no consequences for South China Sea, covid19 or support for Tatmadae genocide. With every crime against humanity or breach of international laws they face no meaningful repercussions. This only emboldens them to commit more atrocities. WTF is going on when NATO and Allies are spending a $$$ trillion annually on military equipment and the CCP are bulldozing democracy across the planet  

That's it, Im on strike and will not pay anymore Tax to fund UN or government and defence forces that continue to put profits before principles and fail the ir Responsibility to Protect as stated in the UN charter of human rights.

905,"These protesters are the Burmese people that I learn to respect a lot.

However, those that keep spamming, whining, demanding, even flaming and scolding others on the likes of CNA FB or U.S. Navy FB when they replied with comments of telling them not to spam.

These Burmese keep posting copy and paste comments like Save Myanmar, We need R2P, We welcome US troops into Myanmar, we want airstrike on the military bases, etc. 

Other people will see these as spams and the posters being an irritating person and a nuisance. They will also view Burmese people as weak and pathetic.

All these will make others feeling less sympathic towards your sufferings and cause. 

It is totally fine to ask for help but so it at the right channels. Posting at CNA or US Navy FB will not get the attention of the World's leaders or UN. 

Let's be honest, no foreign nations will be deploying their troops into Myanmar to fight the Burmese military. There is little to gain and more to lose by deploying troops into Myanmar. 

UN cannot deploy because of various reasons like China and Russia will veto against deployment. India and Vietnam are also against the idea.

Many protesters died in the protest in 88 or 07, no nations send their troops back then, same as now. 

The Burmese people can either live on their knees under military rule or stand up on your feet and fight and even possibly even die for your democracy and freedom.

The choice is for the Burmese people to make."
906,"Thanks for your concern.The militatary terrorists are using grenades, RGBs ,& .50cali Machine guns on unarmed civilians everyday. The death toll has risen up to 500. But we are still fighting for democracy."

It’s high time they’re held accountable by the world.The people of Myanmar are suffering everyday due to the weak response of the world.Every second delayed is a civilian murdered, families destroyed and businesses ruined. I hope the red tape won’t be long enough for China and Russia to seize complete control of Myanmar via the Regime.According to eyewitness accounts, over 500 people has lost their lives since the coup d'état on Feb1. All those brave souls could have been saved if the UN had taken actual action against the SAC terrorists.United Nations Security Council should be abolished to prevent the false hope on the UN to take measures against the SAC Terrorists."

Also if the militia in Kachin collapse PLA will have access to low mountain passes into Arunchal Pradesh and also supply separatists in eastern India as well as anti indian militia in Bangladesh. India will be surrounded with CCP allies like Pakistan where PLA have the port of Gwadar. Possibly India are staying quiet cause of investment by companies like Adani in Myanmar and PLA ""fishing"" boats are already delivering weapons on Bangladesh beaches near the Myanmar border, CCP are testing if the Quad is nothing more than a toothless tiger that will never be effective because of all the vested interests by mining companies and politicians. CCP are bettii they will always put profits before principles so PLA can do what they like."

920,"What you said is true. Spamming comments and demanding things on Pages of U.S. offices and lashing out at people telling to stop isn’t the right way. And we’re trying to educate people on that. If you’re annoyed by them, I deeply apologize on behalf of them.

However, mind you, these are the people having their freedom, properties and families taken away from them. The people are practically grasping at straws at this point. So please, let me ask of you a bit more patience for our people."
921,"Everyone wants the US military until the US military shows up. Then it's ""give us money, kill our enemies, settle our scores, then get out so we can murder anybody we want without interference. Also we're going to complain about everything you do while you're here."" Damn near every war we've been in since WW2 has been some variation of that. Also, when the people asking for our help realize that we're only there to piss off the Russians or the Chinese, and don't really care about them or their country or their cause. That's always fun."
922,Why the *uck nobody in the world seems giving a monkey about your fight..?!? How can I help you..?
923,I know. I'm so sorry about the sacrifice. I hope you'd be safe too.
924,"The UN is a joke. When an unelected dictator who won't even let the people of his country vote can vote himself on the Security Council for the UN not to intervene in crimes against humanity and atrocities that he himself via his Tatmadaw lapdogs  are responsible for. A bit like Hitler being able to veto any intervention in the Holocaust

It has to change. Only democratically elected leaders that have no vested interests with totalitarian states such as China should be allowed to represent the people of the free world Scrap the UN that has been hijacked by China and create the Democratic Nations that do not have to comply with the views of an unelected dictator opposed to democracy and perpetrators of genocide."
925,"She had a Tatmadaw gun at her head. Also she was disqualified from being Prime Minister at the elections because Tatmadaw past a law that it was illegal because she had a foreign husband. So she was through a loophole instated in to the government as a state councillor not PM. A government where you had to gain a 75% majority to pass a motion and the Tatmadaw Junta comprised of 75% . She made a deal with the devil and indeed was very naive. If she had said anything that compromised the junta regarding the Rohingya she would if been back in prison long before February. So indeed many people believe she supported the genocide. Personally I don't believe this is the case despite what she said to UN reps and stuff that was reported in TV and other media outlets. She also could not support Muslims at this time because of the Buddhist Nationalism which in Myanmar is very strong even amoungst her supporters and could not be seen to support Muslims if she wanted to win the election

So now, do you relize that she was not the Prime Minister and did not support the genocide although I'll give you that she was publicly forced to defend the atrocities committed by the Tatmadaw. Naively ti keep her democratic dreams alive. Kind of foolish really considering where she is now. Anyway its not at simple and clear cut as you suggest."
926,"Support, is a strong word. But yes, the elected government had to defend the military. The military was basically taking Democracy hostage, and the ransom was absolute authority in all things military related. The military's racist propaganda and hate campaigns  made it worse too."
927,Kudos for having any form of protective headwear though. Even a construction helmet would protect against concussions.
928,Thailand has been taking in refugees since the 70s. Maybe they're tired of taking in refugees from the same country for 40 years?
929,The Tatmadaw are a big reason why India was able to dismantle major insurgencies in NE India. Lots of rebel groups lived across the border. They've also had a better relationship with them than with Suu Kyi. The Tatmadaw are not CCP's lapdogs and India wants to keep it that way. Numerous Indian projects have been put on hold near Southern Myanmar because of the coup and I can't imagine it being any different for China.
930,"Indian central government and Indian military always had close relations with the Tatmadaw. India was providing military vehicles to Tatmadaw weeks before the coup, so they might be trying to have allies in Tatmadaw and reduce CCP's influence on them."
931,I admire your bravery. I'm not sure how many Americans would if this were to happen here. I'm scared and sad for you and your people and I am ashamed no one will help with real boots on the ground.
932,Indeed. That’s what makes it so sad for me. This young man is face with the prospect of seeing his little sisters sweet smile for the very last time and yet he puts on a brave face for her.
933,Shame on this government
934,"You don't have to apologise on their behalf.

You should also educate them that the higher the hope/expectation, the higher the disappointment if that hope/expectation is not met."
935,"Wow, that is a lot of assumptions I almost feel insulted. We're just asking for any support we can get. If you think US shouldn't get involved, you can always go and protest. At least you won't be shot at the head, abducted and cut up or burned alive, like our people here."
936,"I’m in the US and am trying to make as much noise as possible... it’s daunting and infuriating how small one voice can feel. 

Post on everything you can. Facebook is a start. Make sure you use the hashtags that go straight to the posts that hit **hard**. #MilkTeaAlliance #JusticeForMyanmar are good ones. They lead to posts coming straight out of Myanmar. Use anything to get peoples attention. This picture would be a good one. It’s heartbreaking and moving and shows so much bravery. 

Try to contact Burmese communities wherever you are and help organize marches. The more noise we make the more the world will take notice. Remember, you can be the change; anyone can, they just need to show the same bravery the people of Myanmar have."

At this point, the UN is just a playground for the West and Communists to play political tug-of-war. The UN doesn’t have the balls or the power to actually take action on the crimes of China and Russia."
940,"Since, the beginning of the crisis, I have had the sinking feeling that the acquiescence, the average myanmerese displayed to the junta during the Rohingya episode, has empowered them to be above the law. Is this thinking correct?"
941,"> She made a deal with the devil and indeed was very naive. 

Point of order. 

She knew the Army's constitution was shit, and she refused to participate in the election or allow NLD to broadly participate in the Army's elections.

Then Obama came to Burma and convinced her it would be all ok, and against her better judgement she caved."

958,"Unpopular opinion here, but i think the demonstrators should back down to avoid more of them being killed. The thing is even with Mrs Suu Kyi around, it still wasn't a true democracy. The military was still pulling the strings in every aspect of burma life. Only difference now is that facade is removed. Myanmar never had true democracy.  It takes time and patience, and not an overnight change. I'm worried Myanmar could turn into a syria with prolonged suffering of its people."

974,"I know this is gonna come off as rude or uninformed but I’m an American I don’t know much about su other than she fought politically against Burmese military (junta) then defended them later on (as an outsider I feel like maybe the junta could’ve threatened her or her family or maybe she was an idiot who thought they changed or ignorant enough to ignore them even though she started fighting at a young age) but you can’t blame the people for what the military did. like for example, since I’m American, do you blame me personally for Afghanistan or Iraq or even more recent Syria bombing(s)? When I had nothing to do with it and yeah I can speak out and I do but if I had a gun in my face my instincts of self preservation are so strong you bet imma be more quiet than a mouse because I can do more good alive than dead. so instead of saying karma for the rohingya say I’m sorry to them and the Myanmar people. NO ONE should go through any of this they’re literally murdering kids, little kids, man imagine you just turned 18 and the military barges through your door and claims your 50 year old dad committed treason today even though he hasn’t left home and when he says he didn’t they fire a few warning shots for him to comply but then a stray bullet catches your 5 year old sister in the chest and you gasp or cry so you get beat with the butts of their guns and taken away to never see any of your family again either in a labour camp or dead in a ditch or completely disappear to never even be seen or heard of again. honestly karma for the rohingya will only be served once the junta is brought to justice until then it’s not karma for Myanmar it’s just depressing and sad"

982,"Hello, I’m new here .... can someone explain to me what’s going on in Myanmar?"
983,That struck me too.
984,"It’s recorded 48 till now, more than 1500 arrested, idk might be higher since they usually drag the bodies away even before we had the chance to verify and bury them."
985,"Unfortunately it’s a little more complicated than that, a trade ban would hurt the general population of Myanmar just as much, if not more than it would hurt the government/military. The only thing that could ever really solve this is seemingly the physical removal of most of all officials in the military and government currently and replacing them, which would be very difficult and probably lead to many more casualties along the way. It would’ve been much easier to do had they not gone around and stolen all of their citizens guns before this happened, but that’s done so we need a new solution. This is a glowing example of why the second amendment is a thing in the US, and why no one has or ever will have the right to take our guns. This is why the right to bear arms is so important, and why it’s what keeps all of our other rights in place. 

As for government intervention in Myanmar, I doubt the US will do anything to help as Biden forgot Myanmar was a place years ago. I only hope someone has the balls to stand up and do something. The Myanmar government and military all deserve to be shot like dogs and left for dead for their crimes here, this is absolutely despicable."
986,"Hi so I’m from Myanmar and i’ll try to be brief about it.

This is not the first time the military used extreme force upon the civilians. The first time was when Ne Win withdrew currency notes without compensation just they were “ not his lucky numbers “, causing the Myanmar economy to fall and all the savings of the civilians to be lost overnight, you can search up ‘myanmar 8888’ and ‘myanmar 2007’ for more information . Ever since then, things have been tense, Myanmar have the longest ongoing civil war in the world plus people are starting to fight back for democracy and so they decided to do a real election for the first time in decades and the opposing party NLD won. And that party won again in 2020 by a landslide ( like of course the party would win, it’s either that or decades of military dictatorship again ) but the military announced that there was an ‘election fraud’ with no evidence and captured the leaders of NLD overnight, cut off wifi, data, phonelines, flights in or out of the country and closed banks to stop the withdrawal of cash. They said that they’ll hold the election again in a year but those words coming from the military, it’s pretty hard to believe. So yes, that’s the overview of why there is a military coup and why the civilians are protesting."
987,"If I were to say, it will be a long conversation."
988,i find conflicting numbers on twitter. people talking about 52 deaths today alone ! do you know any credible sources please?
989,"I see... thank you, Im gonna look up what you said
I hope the best for the people in Myanmar.."
990,"This is why you never give up the right to defend yourself, people!! It was long ago that Myanmar was going around confiscating it’s citizens’ guns, and when they declared they had pretty much all of them, this happens. And the anti gun groups say “oh this will never happen today, that was just 200 years ago!”, well, as usual you’re wrong. Support the 2A, support the right to defend yourself from ANY threat, and just as importantly right now, support Myanmar!!"
991,"I think the number 48 is the one UN counted but UN wasn’t there when the shooting were happening, the people were so I’d believe the people more. And credible sources about the death counts ? UN does that but we don’t because 1 death is just as bad as 52 deaths to us. But i do believe the deaths are being undercounted since plenty of bodies are recorded being dragged away so yeah ( you can find the footages here as well )"

Looking at top weibo discussions, you won't find anything about China government reponse on it.

The second post is blaming George Soros supporting the protest as a evidence the west is behide the protest.

A lot of them are putting the blame on the protesters and related it to Hong Kong about ""The west is behind it to creates chaos!""

1029,"they are atacking chinese factories because they are misleading the problem, the problem isnt china, the problem is the military coup wich has 0 ties to china. Its a way of changing direction and confuse protestors, soon the people wont concetrate in 1 target but multiple. Protestors could have burned goverment builidings, poloce buildings etc. but they decided to use their stregth on chinese factories wich contributed 0 to democracy and only hurted their economy. The goverment is using china as a scapegoat to confuse and focus protestors in other things that are irrelevant for democracy, its an old tactic, like when mc donalds says black matters so we think they arent the problem when they lobby america to counterprogress progressive reforms that could then end black inequality in america. Its strategies that sadly are efective and its working like when they burned chinese factories that had 0 things to do with the goverment."
1030,"how is the lack of chinese goverment resposnse has to do with them actually interfer in myanmar?  
There is literally 0 evidences that they made the coup and the only envidence you have is that ""the chinese goverment didnt say anything so they did the coup!"" im flabbergasted how people are so desesperated to hate on china that they just point fingers on them with 0 evidence.
 They blame george soros for blaming china and making protestors burn chinese factories wich acomplished 0 and only hurted the local economy.

This is the top post on weibo(chinese largest social media) about Myanmar.

It said ""Myanmar detains Soros-linked group, so Soro must be supporting the protest. Which is a proof the US is creating chaos in Myanmar like Hong Kong, and trying to attack china!""

China is selling the story ""The west is behind the chaos of Myanmar just like Hong Kong"" on their internet."

1151,"Of course China have interference in Myanmar. I mean you are just beside? China and you think China will not invest money and have interest in Myanmar? 
But this is different to say China backed the coup. There is no evidence about China sending troops or weapons into Myanmar or what."

1159,">https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/chinese-made-drones-reportedly-monitor-anti-regime-protests-myanmar.html

That's doesn't qualify as a standard of evidence. Once the acquisition is completed, you cannot hold the manufacturer accountable for its use.

Otherwise every gun manufacturer would be liable for their death. 

I get that there may be anti-Chinese sentiments there and all.

But if you are from Myanmar, I just want to know if the military junta there actually hired an Israeli-Canadian lobby firm for access to Washington?"
1160,"Oh, please spare me your ignorance and stop trying to use selective ignorance as a form of denial. Pathetic  Makes me sick."
1161,"I didn't say it was an evidence but I'm just telling you to read this article if you wanna know more about China.Yes they did. They announced that in a press conference. They said they hired the lobbyist to show the world the ""real"" situations. After that I never heard from that so called ""lobbyist"". 

Edit - There's an enormous hydroelectric power development project which will produce energy to China. There were way too many environmental impacts. So, out civilian government stopped that. But as soon as the military came to power, they announced that they will continue this project."
1162,"You don't know how a discussion works, don't you? If you want to prove something it is on you to present an argument. 

Besides, I've never heard about Global Times until now, thanks"
1163," I did read the article about drones, and again, the manufacturer and seller is not liable for its use.

I did some reading on the dam issue, assuming I found the right one:

https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/23/myanmar-china-dam-deal-junta-democracy/

It would seem that the military regime announced its resumption in hope of Chinese support — China has yet to openly endorse it because they seem to be aware of the negative optics.

So it doesn’t seem that China supported a coup for its dam. But rather the coup was indigenous and hoped to use the dam as leverage."
1164,For someone who has never heard of the Global Times you seem to know an awfully lot about CCP foreign policy. Your the one claiming CCP/PLA are not interfering in Myanmar with no proof not me. I have plenty evidence to suggest otherwise and it makes no difference if you believe me or not cause your loyalty is to the CCP and that will never change no matter what I say to delusional brainwashed wumaos like you.

Of course she needs to talk about her trip and how the people approaching her and being detained because it sheds a lot of light into the dire situation.

On another note, she did try to do the story justice, so kudos for that,  but she can't act like she's first to report. There are many other Western journalists who have been covering the story since day 1. Not to mention the incredible domestic media. The wire services have done a great job and even NYtimes had a story in burmese on the same day Clarissa did her first ""report""."

1203,"Well she doesn't act like the first to report, but the first to report from inside the country, which is a fact. She always lauds the local journalists. Though most of what she reported is the same as other Western media as well, she managed to give an exclusive interview and we all enjoyed watching the general looking like a deer caught in headlights.

As to how she got invited, are you thinking of some conspiracy? Like CNN pays millions of dollars to the military go get in? But I'm not sure if they would take the risk of that information leaking out. That's the only inexcusable thing I can think of. Anyway, I don't really care for conspiracies.

Look, why are even comparing here? I don't see any good out of having disdain for a certain journalist because we think they didn't do as well as others, esp since said journalist credits the others too. Sure, maybe other reports are better in quality but CNN is better in dramatisation xD which is good for exposure to the general populations.

Anyway, we're on the same side here, you and I. And I don't really feel like we need to compare and criticize any journalist for reporting this. I've made my point don't see the use of furthering this debate either, so I'll just bid you a good day."

I am vocal about the indigenous Canadian peoples struggle am I hypocritical if I mention them and not every other disadvantaged group?

Furthermore, many people don’t actually agree with genocide and killing of innocent Rohingyan people. Prior to the coup, there was a deep division within Myanmar’s society and lack of unity caused by decades of mistrusts and hate created by previous governments and extremist people. 

People in Myanmar aren’t born hating others, it’s the society they grew up in that led many to be this way."

Once again, hope that Myanmar people will find peace and live the happy lives they deserve. It's sad to see one of our friend country being like this.."
1254,Rest in power.
1255,They will not be forgotten in our heart.
1256,It's a very good question that UN still has no answer for it.

1258,"No one will do shit, that's how it works in politics."
1259,There won't be any intervention. The US has had enough of wars and no one else has the balls to do anything
1260,"The kids were bright, brave and died with dignity."
1261,"All they got was a very thick text book in a backpack in a hope for protection against real bullets and battle field ammunition. No weapons, nothing else , just pure hearts!"
1262,"The people of Myanmar are incredibly sincere, smart and courageous. You hear 'Live free or die' bandied about all the time, but they are feeling that exact sentiment. People around the world support CDM."
1263,"Most of the protest started as peaceful and non violence. After a few weeks, military started using excessive force to terrorize the public. There are two ethnic arm forces that vow to fight the military but they are quite far away from big cities such as Yangon and Mandalay. So people especially the youngsters feel it’s protest for Myanmars future now whatever it may cost or become military slaves. That’s how they feel now with no immediate help from outside."
1264,It’s being discussed and planned
1265,"Unfortunately more lives were lost back in 1988 without the victory. 

We do know what Koreans are all about. Yes we thank you deep from our hearts."

1267,???
1268,They supposed to be lovely book worms at the university having bright future......may be doctors....may be teachers. But now dreams shattered. Protect them before a generation is lost.
1269,"Forget about the UN they are toothless.

The big problem in this is China; all the time they can get an Indian Ocean port in a ‘friendly’ country they will be supporting and propping up this regime because of the big bucks China will be willing to pay."
1270,"The UN never helped anyone, so don't expect anything from them."
1271,Blank the UN.
1272,"Yep you’re totally right unfortunately.

Even if there were a mass uprising, the regime were overthrown and democracy returned, no doubt China would do it’s best to destabilise the new government until it achieved it’s long term aims."
1273,"Ok then explain to me why **Russia, India and Vietnam** support the same UN stance as China

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-un-idUSKBN2B209S](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-un-idUSKBN2B209S)

Geopolitics isn't so straightforward and many laymen here don't grasp the intricacies of big power play. India also doesn't want to upset the military because of their investments in the region"
1274,"You missed the important bit about oil or natural resources, throw those into the mix and suddenly politicians wake up."
1275,Too true. Another war in SE Asia? USA not going there...
1276,"But, why would they even use excessive force? Isn't that illegal and offensive? And why won't other countries and the UN respond to this behavior? I'm really confused!"
1277,"The kid from top right was Khan Nyar Hein, a student from University of Medicine #1. When interviewed his mom, she said his goal was to provide free service to poor patients. That's because he grew up from a poor family, and never heard about his dad. How lovely was that idea. Unfortunately he never got to fulfill his wish."
1278,"Lol, are you sure it's just china? Cause **India, Russia and Vietnam** are also blocking UN Action. You people have been so blinded about ""China"" you don't realise other countries have the same stance

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-un-idUSKBN2B209S](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-un-idUSKBN2B209S)

People need to try the Asian way of dealing with things. The problem with hard intervention is that you'll end up another Libya. Removing the army completely would break Myanmar into several independent states."
1279,"Pls don't bring that bullshit article here friend.. That's U.S. newspaper you know. Of course, they (U.S.) want to look like a hero, by making other countries villians. If they want to do something, they will (you can see Iraq). It's just that your country does not bring them enough value to risk.

And you know this day will come when someone brings their 'human right' to your home :("
1280,Well idk if you knew but Myanmar is one of largest producers of heroin...
1281,"China and Russia have veto powers, so UN is basically useless in this"
1282,Those kids are all bright and lovely and I hope that their families would walk out of the grief and be strong. My deepest sympathy!
1283,"Not removing the army will turn whole country into slaughter house also, this is the fact now as you can see. In addition, all citizens and all ethnic folks want the Federal system, all independent states like US. The selected government wants to form the Federal Army and fight back the military now.   
So what is your point about kissing Army ass?"
1284,"The army, like any other public body in a country is subservant to the people, do you fully comprehend what that means?

The army is there to carry out the elected politicians bidding on behalf of the people, not think that it is some political body able to govern the people to it’s will.

The army and to a certain extent police of Myanmar have totally lost this fundamental basis of democracy and they need to step back from the abyss that is a certain civil war with dire consequences for everyone in the region.

The elected politicians need to be freed, the army need to disarm and be ready for the wrath of justice as without any doubt it is arriving for the crimes committed against the people of Myanmar over the past decades let alone the past month."
1285,they ditched it in favor of Yaba
1286,What are veto powers?
1287,Sounds like UN needs its Democracy first before acting like it's all about helping the world.
1288,"And trying to remove them now will escalate this into a full blown war. Have you seen Syria, Libya or Venezuela? Not a pretty sight is it? There is still a chance to resolve this without escalating to full blown war. I've seen the exact same story play out time and time again with sanctions or military intervention

You'll see the breakup of Burma, because the ethnic groups barely held together in the first place. Maybe that's what you want - Who knows. 

The Myanmar protestors are without a leader and they're running around like a headless chicken. The outside nations first need to call for dialogue without any threats. Problem is, situation went south too fast and calm must first be restored, whether it is one side or the other."
1289,"basically if there is a vote to do something and 10 countries say yes & 2 say no, if one of those countries that say no has veto powers, than the vote is a no, despite the majority ruling yes

(basically this is a provision so that a few countries cannot just team up and do whatever they want, the key goal of the UN is to prevent major wars like WW1/2 etc, so they can only really do anything if all major powers agree to it)

In this case, both Russia and China have said they will veto (aka say no) any action the UN wants to make to help myanmar"
1290,"There is an another brave man casually prepared chewing betel nuts and talking on the phone while getting shot in the goddamn arm! Anybody seen that clip? He acts like nothing happened to him while paramedics are taping his arm. 
That dude got serious balls."
1291,I can’t fathom the amount of courage he has!
1292,"Handsome man and a freedom fighter.
Get better soon"
1293,Is there any more information on this? Any particular reason why he was smiling? Did he comment on anything? Did he survive and where was he shot?
1294,He is a hero.

1301,This mfer is a true hero. I wish I could help y'all out over there
1302,"Sorry I haven't been responding to the comments in the thread. The junta cut off wireless broadband in order to control the news of their atrocities. I had to wait until I could get fiber internet, and now I'm back."
1303,worst happened with rohynga people and nobody cared
1304,Where was he shot?  Looks pretty staged to me.
1305,I’ve seen that clip. I don’t have it saved though. Dude’s got steel for balls.
1306,The regime’s terrorists who are even scared of slingshots have nothing over him.
1307,I'm sure he will!
1308,"The military terrorists are using grenades and heavy artillery on civillians in Sein Pann, Mandalay. According to field reports, at least six people were injured by grenades, 3 were shot and one was killed by headshot.Currently only that he escaped the military's bombarding fire in Sein Pann, Mandalay."
1309," Yes, he is. Along with the brave people protesting and fighting for our freedom.But the death toll has risen up to 550 since Coup D'état on Feb1.The lives of our fallen heroes could be saved if the International Community had taken actual action on Brutal Military Terrorists."

1316,You can help us out by donating the CRPH and displaced minorities. ^^
1317,"People actually did and still do care.

A real issue was that a fascist was sitting in the White House that enabled Turkey to massacre every kurdish person, women, children, men, soldiers, they wanted.

The USA under Trump and his fascist consorts withdrew military backing from the region because Trump with his daddy issues loved cuddling up to genocidal dictators.

Fuck Trump."
1318,"There are people who did. Activists who cared were exiled out of the country. Politicians who dared speak up were assassinated; like U Ko Ni, he himself was a Muslim."
1319,"There are many who cared. But still, I can't deny that most of us brainwashed into thinking the Rohingya are evil immigrants who fled from Bangladesh trying to take over the land. It's the result of the racist, xenophobic Tatmadaw and the previous military regime's propaganda and misinformation campaigns erasing the history and the existence of Rohingya people. It's part of the reason why we're fighting this regime now. Most of us are horrified of the monsters we were brainwashed into, and we wish for it to never happen again."
1320,"It’s in Sein Pann, Mandalay. If you have doubts, you can look it up .The medical worker on the left is a friend, so at the very least I have an eyewitness source."
1321,How do you save Facebook videos? That’s where my friends are posting a lot about attacks from military.
1322,"Yes, I know. People care, their leaders don't care much."
1323,"What, in your opinion is the most efficient way for the international community to take action? I see a lot of mixed reactions to various proposals from heavy-hitting sanctions, military action, providing funding/weapons to the opposition to targeted air strikes. What do you think (or any Myanmar national) is the best course of action? Thanks, just looking for opinion on this."
1324,"In fact, all the protesters are heroes. There they praise not only him but all of you.

1332,"Thank you, appreciate it!"
1333,"Why United Nations do nothing at all? Hundreds of people are dead already! I think UN peacekeepers & NATO must overthrow the junta, like they did with Saddam in 2003 and in Yugoslavia in the 90s."
1334,This is not NSFW. People should see this.
1335,How about a realistic photo to show their brutality..cartoons don't have the same affect of the shock of reality.These army types in Burma are not realising the risk of war crime hearings if they get caught out.
1336, Magic Realism
1337,"put the standing journalist behind a screen, and a dead journalist beside the dead protester and it's a bit more apt. 

It's heart rending what's happening right now. You guys stand tall. You got this."
1338,Totally agree ..let's vote for a government that can send drones to assist
1339,"There's never enough to show the truth.
Self righteous bots"
1340,"Ok no problem..it's a matter of opinion. 
Do what what want and follow your heart."
1341,Becasue they can’t do anything unless every country agrees to it. Which wouldn’t happen. Only online social protest would help
1342,I think it's because of China's position in the UN. They already called Myanmar an internal matter and that no one should interfere.
1343,They didnt overthrown saddam in 2003 the US basically acted unikaterally (france and the UK came along for the ride?)
1344,There are enough photos in this subreddit.

1362,CONQUER!
1363,I'm so sorry that my countrymen are using this as an outlet for our politics in the comments. It's truly shameful.
1364,How much blood will it take for someone to do something???
1365,Why does the police support the military?
1366,Do none of the civilians have guns to light these pricks up?
1367,Juntas are son of bitches!!!
1368,"I'm keeping you an yours in my thoughts. Please stay safe and alive, friend."
1369,"Why not make your own insurgency group? And unite with the other ethnic insurgency groups? This type of protesting will not work against people with no morals.
You need to fight fire with fire sometimes."
1370,I don’t see an execution tho? Just a beating?
1371,CCP is now in control
1372,Never let your government deny you your human right to keep and bear arms.
1373,Fair enough.
1374,"Where the fuck are my fellow Americans!

1378,WTH IS HAPPENING TO MYANMMAR IVE SEEN SO MANY POSTS ABOUT THER POLICE TODAY
1379,we don't need a flood we need a rapture
1380,"I just realized that now going through the comments. I saw an article that Qanon believers are calling for a similar coup in the states. I really hope that stays a fantasy and doesn't have a bloodier repeat of the capitol riots, cause we are living through it."
1381,"It happens on every thread. I know its not the same, but if you go on any post about Scottish independence, it's full of Americans saying, ""Yes I think Scotland should be independent!"" without having no prior knowledge whatsoever to the situation at hand.

This, however, is far more serious and the fact people are using what is happening in Myanmar to promote any sort of politics in Europe or America is disgusting."
1382,"I don't think they ever concerned themselves with bloodshed, maybe if myanmar was sitting on top of some big ass oil field or something, but unfortunately I don't think we'll be hearing alot from the U.N. on this one. It's a fucked up feeling to watch history keep repeating itself and being able to do nothing about it but to just watch it happen. For what little it matters my heart goes out to all of Myanmar and HK and everywhere else that has to suffer under these bastards, may you all find peace in the end."
1383,You’re someone! Get-r-done!
1384,"Fear, police usually are living in government compounds controlled by the military. Any wrong move and it's a threat to their families. Even in the army, if someone wants to quit, more often than not, it's denied. The usual talking point is that you can only leave in a body bag or prison."
1385,"No they don’t, and coming soon to America!"
1386,"And trigger an unfettered war? They may have guns but they don’t have jets, tanks, and artillery. The minority people groups in Myanmar have been fighting and evading the Burmese government since the end of WW2 and it’s not going too well"
1387,Indeed they are!
1388,"Thank you for your kind words, friend."
1389,"Yeah, that's starting to happen. We'll see where this goes."
1390,The freedom fighter has united
1391,"Actually that was my bad. I should have included the audio which makes it easier as you can hear when they shoot him. If you watch the guy in white being escorted out, he gets shot in the back later on and fell to the ground. They then dragged his limp body."
1392,"That's the difference here though. We never had that to begin with, apart from the ethnic insurgency groups, majority of the population does not have arms."
1393,That is not why this is happening
1394,What is wrong with you
1395,You volunteering?
1396,"American intervention will only cause more pain, rape and destruction. As it damn well near always has since the start of the Cold War.

War needs to come from the inside. Simple as that."
1397,American government betrayed South Vietnam.

This is their fight for Independence, they need to do this themselves."

1404,"A goddamn military coup is what happened. Now the military and police are power tripping, and terrorizing unarmed civilians who are peacefully protesting. They have been brutally beating up protesters or using live rounds to disperse crowds."
1405,QAnon please stay out of Myanmar. You are doing enough damage to the US already with your conspiracy theory and weaponizing fake news and social media. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6hdCg8taI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn6hdCg8taI)

1407,"Oh, it will. Why? Because we have done fuck all to hold the people accountable who did it. That is going to do one thing, and one thing only. Make them feel like there are no consequences for trying. So, if at first you don't succeed, try, and try again! It's stupid. The constitution they like to hold up says to literally execute people for doing that. I'm not saying we should go that far. But, there needs to be some punishment to deter it next time. I say next time, because there's no doubt in my mind it will happen again. They stormed congress with Trump, their messiah, in the white house. Imagine what they will do now Biden is in. They're not going to hold back, and people are going to die unnecessarily because democrats are spineless twits. They literally tried to overthrow the government and you didn't do anything! I'm tired of this reach across the aisle, we need unity shit when the other side wants nothing less than death for everyone who opposes them"
1408,You and me both. Please stay safe!!
1409,"Oh please you Americans only cause genocide and massacre in other countries.  9/11 was the only bad thing to happen in the U.S and that pale in comparison to millions of Vietnamese, Khmer, middle-eastern that lost their lives due to the Americans (betrayal of South Vietnam)."
1410,Y’all are straight retarded they outright hate big government why would they want more government
1411,Yeah! It's also a very worrying trend. The military generals are regurgitation everything from the Trump playbook on voter fraud. I can even draw a direct line between the capitol riots to this coup. Hopefully this doesn't gain grounds in other parts of the world. Wouldn't want to impose this on anyone else.
1412,please pray for thailand too.

1416,And the fucking indian court wants to send the Rohingyas back to Myannmar where Junta's are probably going to kill them all. I fucking hate this world and our species.
1417,What a merciless world we are living in. Being Indian I am extremely sorry for the actions of my country🙏. I wish people could see this as humanity issue rather than just Myanmar issue.
1418,Someone please punch this murderous toddler
1419,"People of Myanmar still have a looooong way to go.. if this battle is lost, the future generations will think of the freedom fighters we have now as terrorists and violent protesters. Just like the Chinese"
1420,"Sometimes I just wish there was a secret group of BAMFs that would go into these countries some how and smear these type of fucks out of existence. I know it wouldn’t help in most all cases, but it would be nice to read that they are no longer breathing aka terrorizing their people."

America prides itself in toppling dictators and installing democracies in nations that aren’t ready for it or don’t want it,
 But you have just the nation with a democratic backbone, and popular support for such, yet America does nothing."
1424,No he hasn't looked in the mirror.  His wife emasculates him enough without looking in the mirror and realizing what a pathetic little man he is.
1425,That’s not even mentioning that he’s the leader of the group that destabilized the country in the first place.

Time to time we have such evils among us trying to destroy our own kind. This is everyone responsibility to stand up any injustice in anywhere you maybe. It can grow and spread like cancer if we don’t treat them as early as possible."
1441,As a Colombian learning more of the origin of our conflict i couldn't agree more. Yet in our case is the government fault and the cold war power made it much worse.

1444,"Yeah, the fucking US CIA has toppled a LOT of governments. Well, Myannmar doesn't have oil so the inperialists don't care about implementing ""democracy"", do they?"
1445,"It's the same with the UK. It needs our attention and interference now. I believe leaders would interfere if they had nothing to loose, theyre looking after their countries own interests... trade with China. Trade comes before human life and heritage, doesn't it make you hate the world we are living in!"
1446,"Maybe you guys are a bit too close to China and that makes Murica scared to intervene. Or maybe they just have yet to discover anything of worth from your nation? 

Like come on. They will definitely go there and help you if they can find something that is worth all the risk of coming all the way to your nation like strategic geo-political locations or fine and dandy resources, such as black gold. And speaking of risk, yes that’s a lot of risks that can attract even more unwanted consequence and I dare not imagine what bad things can come due to foreign intervention.

Look, salvation and freedom doesn’t come free. There is always a hidden cost behind any seemingly righteous act. It is better that you find your own way of solving the bloody puzzle which is tragically difficult. 

Also, the UN? When was the last time the UN managed to end a war with nothing saved for peacekeepers and public denouncement anyway? Don’t expect much help from UN either. They can do something for you but that something won’t change the tide of the struggle.

Nevertheless, good luck. You will soon understand the cruelty of this world and that knowledge can either strike your morale down or empower your will to a greater extent."
1447,You forgot how they dismantled it as well.
1448,The British started this mess by choosing one segment of a country to control the rest.
1449,"I'm British and would like to mention that a good portion of us aren't imperialist idiots. The situation in Myanmar is about democracy and freedom, the right for the people to lead through their own elected representatives without foreign interference, from my point of view, this has more to do with America than Britain. 

Admittedly, if Myanmar was in the commonwealth help *might* come from Canada, U.K., New Zealand etc and the commonwealth is much more chill now (allowing republics and stuff), but when Myanmar left republics weren't allowed, there were likely more reasons to leave (not that that isn't reason enough) but I'm definitely not well read on the history of Myanmar.

Also (assuming this guy is a nationalist), he probably supports Brexit. One of the main ""attractive"" points of Brexit is more independence from a group of many nations that some say doesn't give us enough freedom (the EU is better than the commonwealth of the 40s and Britain used to be able to vote through Members of European Parliament)."

Also you can farm in almost everywhere in myanmar...

Which is also the reason why myanmar was super weak during the colonization era as resources are so easy to obtain which resulted in slated fish Kings...

And after almost half a century of unrestricted resource exploitation from china there are still many resource rich places...

1485,"judging from the lower left currency being 冥通銀行 ""issued"", I think the rest of them are fake ""hell money"" as well. It's a kind of folk religion practice to give the departed currency to ""spend"" in the afterlife. Sort of like a coin on your eyes to pay the ferryman, except everything in the afterlife costs money too. Don't think about the hell economy and inflation too hard, it's a way for grieving family to provide for their loved ones and keep their memory alive.

1486,He is Chinese born in Myanmar. The dollars are not real. May be according to their tradition.
1487,"It’s called ‘Hell Money’. A Chinese tradition dating back centuries. Chinese believe the dead go down to be judged on their previous life and there are layers of hell depending on your sins/ merits.

Good souls can go to heaven. Some are reborn. Some souls have to stay longer. Don’t ask how long as no one really knows but they need money to buy food, services etc just like you would on Earth.

It’s not just money but figurines representing servants and maids are burnt, gold bars, clothing, housing, cars, latest mobile phones,etc are all burnt. All these items are made out of paper. This is so that they have a good afterlife.

This tradition is a mixture of aspects between Taoism and Buddhism which is practised to this day. The Chinese really respect and honour their dead even after they’ve gone."
1488,"Yeah, he is Chinese born in Myanmar. Please don't write any hate words about ပြည်ကြီးတရုတ်. There are some lobby who want conflict between Myanmar and Chinese.

If you look up Dehong Dai, it is a Shan dialect, they are Shan people, from Chinese side of the border. On these borders, Shans, Kachins, Was, Palongs, etc move freely across borders, just like Chins who cross Burma-India border. Dr. Sasa who is Chin moved from Chin State to India to get his education as an example. 

Historically, Dais or Thai people, and Tibeto-Burman people have been migrating from what's known today as China for more than 2000 years for various reasons including pressure from the dominant Hans, and continues to do so today. So they are the late arrivals of our peoples."

But telling the truth even most of the Islam in Myanmar didn't know much about the Rohingya thoroughly because of language problems, brainwashed and media blockage.

1508,Well said.
1509,"Glad that you ask. It is a long story. I assume you are Chinese so I will explain Parallel to Qing Dynasty and the start of the century of humiliation. China has like the Chinese Chamber of commerce in Myanmar. It is the same as What the British did in HK and the century of humiliation. That Chamber of commerce as a  first-class citizen in Myanmar while we citizen of Myanmar are treated third or second class in our own country. They collude with the Myanmar military which is like the Qing dynasty who didn't dare to industrialize China because they will need to educate and empower the mass han population and it will be the end of their dynasty. So is the Myanmar Military, they didn't dare to educate or give democracy in Myanmar or it will be the end of military dictatorship. btw, Myanmar Junta hired an Israeli lobbyist with 2 million dollars. The money came from the Chinese Chamber of commerce account when it was traced. This group did all sorts of things to prop up Dictatorship in Myanmar in return. The junta gave him all sort of preferential treatment. They become first-class citizens in Myanmar. Whether it is mining jade or other resources it is the CHina who owns them all. It is like how British is the first-class citizen in Hong Kong. They start to pull like No Burmese allowed in their restaurant or business in Myanmar like How the British did in HK "" no Chinese or dogs allowed sign in HK"" in the century of humiliation. just Yesterday, a Chinese employer summoned a Myanmar employee to make a payment. but he didn't pay the promised amount and he called the soldiers to shoot the employees when they demand the promised amount. 5 deaths 70 arrested, 4 more death later. Chinese embassy and Beijing cover up all their corruption and neo-colony style dealing in their media in turn, they support the dictator in Myanmar. btw the Japan Chamber of commerce did the same. They tried to pull the same shit as the Chinese group did. But when the truth is surfaced, Japan's foreign ministry didn't cover-up. They give us Justice. that is the fking difference. also, the Chinese embassador to Myanmar is a fkiing corrupted shit. The way he manage the relationship in Myanmar is just giving a hand to CIA campaign against smearing China."

1531,"This is so unbelievably tragic and unacceptable.  He had so much life left to live, but a corrupt military thinking they had the ""best"" interest of their citizens is instead murdering them with no conscience. From us viewing it from the outside world we need to try harder to spread the message of what is taking place here."
1532,This is unacceptable why the fuck the powerful countries is doing nothing against it.
1533,"They know they're not protecting jack shit. They're there to seize and consolidate power by any means, and their current means are terrorizing and killing the civilian population to instill fear. Fear is a powerful tool and these monsters are in a position to wield it well and will do so, regardless of the victim's age. The monsters have no humanity left in them.

As to the tragedy of the newest victim, rest in peace little buddy. 13 is no age for the dead."
1534,"They don't . They are following orders. And like it was pointed out in another thread. The Junta prepared for this. By moving military families into secure areas weeks before the coup.

So these soldiers are now free to do whatever they want. Their families are safe/under 'protective custody'....read into that what you will."
1535,"They are...kind of. 

The usual: Harsh words. Sanctions. Wringing of hands.....

And once it is a full blown civil war. With thousands dead. Millions displaced. Then they will vote to send in peacekeepers. 

But the vote will fail because China or Russia will veto it.

So back to: Harsh words. Sanctions. Wringing of hands....

Syria is the only example you need of how well the security council works in its current form.

TBH since China and Russia insist on keeping the world out of areas most of us want to help/put a stop to. Why don't we just kick them from the security council? 

Oh wait. That's NATO...."

The Myanmar military, obviously.

As a half German, half French, I know my share of revolutions and how to achieve what you want. So my affliction would be the will to pay the ultimate price for what I deem correct, if need be. Been there, done that. I know what it feels like being shot.

If telling people that they have to fight for their rights is fucking wrong, then the obvious answer is: Everything."
1548,"Yeah seriously, how unhelpful. I personally have made comments here trying to discuss what people can do to protect themselves, but never from a place of “whats wrong with you, why aren’t you fighting back” when theres literal video evidence of the people coming together to create barricades and weapons out of whatever they have and fight in any way they can against literal fucking military sanctioned murderers wielding firearms.

Edit: my biggest thing at this point is if its at all possible to take down a small group of them and seize some of their weapons it could help, even if slightly. With the KIA attacking military bases Im hoping things will turn."

Which part of it? The one where I saw shit like that happen live, right before my eyes? I experienced conflict and war, I saw people die for no reason at all. That's why I'm so determined to tell people to stand up and fight for their rights, make it count.

That boy died in vain. It was unnecessary, it was stupid. This shouldn't happen. But again: This ***will*** happen all over again if the citizens of Myanmar don't stand up for themselves and set an end to the dictatorship."

1556,"You think that these people coordinating without weapons is going to help them against a fully equipped and experienced military? You think ""it"" wont continue if they actively fight back? You're right! I bet the military retreats in fear the first time a marble bounces off their helmet from those weak ass single-shot butane weapons.

The limited means include the usual sanctions, diplomatic protests, etc. This might works if the members of the U.N. are unanimous but as in many instances, they are not. So in this case, countries such as China and in ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines are obstacles to any meaningful pressure on the coup leadership. Many, if not most, foreigners and their countries dearly wish that they can do more but limitations are there...still whenever there is opportunities, they will do what they can. Still, these terrorists will not go unpunished... the world will hold them accountable to the bloody and despicable acts against their own countrymen. Do not lose hope, you will succeed in the end... Also death is very useful as it will surely get rid of all dictators."

1658,"I don't think this is really true, China had business with the Junta sure, and they had business with  Aung San Suu Kyi and if the protestors win they'll have business with the new government. The coup doesn't really benifit China because it threatens their investment in Myanmar."

Keep getting in the way CCP.. there may be a revolution in your country soon.  Like Hong Kong. 

Hong Kong is China’s wallet and they had to give it up to stop the beginning of a revolution in mainland China. Myanmar will be a second attempt to set off a revolution in China. 

Maybe we should invite the US and EU to set up military bases in Myanmar after the revolution."
1666,"Evidence: trust me mate!

There’s no evidence whatsoever. The “best” that came out was a picture of the military dictatorship shaking hands with a CCP official. So no, people are just exploiting the suffering of the Myanmar people to shit on China. These people don’t care about Myanmar at all."
1667,"No, not sure if they’re directly funding the Junta but they did send delegates to celebrate armed forces day two weeks ago, so if you send soldiers to celebrate with the oppressing army, seems like you’re on the side of the oppressor.

Also up until the transition to civilian government, China had been buddies with the Junta. They and Russian from what I remember are blocking UN sanctions and speaking out against international sanctions.

China deff wants to be friends with the current government because they want access to the Indian Ocean. Icing on the cake if that government is also an authoritarian regime that suppresses protestors and democratic rule.

Also, Russia does directly supply the Junta. Russia also sent delegates to Myanmar for armed forces day."
1668,You don't even realize how many actual fascists and various right-wing dictators were supported by the US

1682,"Okay ""invite the US and EU to set up military base"", why would u think that is a good idea? That's literally asking for more trouble than anything. Besides the US only went in if Myanmar has anything that they can offer (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan). If Myanmar is so valuable to the US then they would be heavily involved by now. I gotta remind you that USA isn't the good guy, neither does Russia or China. They themselves funded military junta coups in South American nations before too. So please don't look to USA for help or see them as a good guy"
1683,Thank you for clarifying
1684,Sure but China just wants it's interests in Myanmar they are not invested in the Junta and I'm sure they would rather the coup not happened as the instability threatens their influence. If the protesters win they'll want to do business as well.
1685,Whataboutism.
1686,"The West are NOT democratic. Full stop.

It's actually a lot more viable that the US funded the Myanmar Junta than the Chinese since the Chinese has nothing to gain from it. The US tho? A heavy forward base for them to pincer China into submission.

I think you guys shouldnt said that ""The West are democratic"" when talking about anything in SEA tbh because they sucks dicks.

Myanmar is basically an Imperialist coup in order for the imperialist to enter your country. So whatever you do, DO NOT ASK FOR UN HELP, AS WELL AS DO NOT ASK FOR THE IMPERIALIST WEST FOR HELP. You guys are better than this."

However you damn stupid protesters try to blame the whole coup to us and you think this will help you? No basically all Chinese who know your true face don't have much faith in your protest now.
1701,"To elaborate more,

8 countries including China and Russia are sending their delegates to said military parade. Russia role seems to be more prominent as they send in a deputy defense minister, and also explicitly voiced support for the Junta, while China is still being careful on maintaining their vague position and interest.

So yeah, even if China caved in to the pressure and agree to the UN resolution, it will be futile because Russia is still there.

Also, regarding the veto use, China's excuse is they always oppose any intervention policy and support sovereignty more. I haven't read much on China (and Russia)'s veto use yet, but there are many free research journals if you want to read more on that.

Just from simple google search, i already found these 3. If you put a little more time in it, i'm sure you will found more study cases and analysis that is more relevant to current situation.

1702,"It’s an interesting dynamic because popular opinion seems to be turning against China, so then where does that leave China if the protestors do win? I’d think China would prefer the Junta at this point, though they were working with Aung San Suu Kyi up untilI the coup.

My assumption is that China didn’t necessarily want the coup to happen, but now that it has they want the Junta to win and maintain absolute authoritarian control."
1703,Everyone is afraid of the Globalist organization the UN so they dont give it the power and authority to effectively intervene. Yet everyone expects it to resolve the worlds conflicts. World made the UN useless long ago.
1704,"UN does not have troops on its own. The troops are made up of troops given by its members.

These troops are basically peacekeepers and do not participate in offensive military operations. 

No nations would want to intervene physically by deploying their troops into Myanmar to fight the Tatmadaw. There is too much to lose than to gain."

1733,"And yet everyone expects them to waltz in there and start shooting. There will be support outside of Myanmar, but only so much can happen within their borders without the support of the government"
1734,"Literally never lol, the best thing the UN could do is provide material aid to the protesters. Invading will destroy infrastructure, kill innocents, amd likely result in a Government that is hardly, if at all, better then the modern dictatorship."
1735,It worked in South Korea and Kuwait (well i don't know if you would consider Kuwait democratic...).
1736,"People don't realised that before any deployment of troops, there has to be serious considerations of the possible repercussions and consequences of any actions taken be it military, economical or others. 

Many people including the majority of the Burmese thinks it is very simple, just deploy, go in with guns blazing. They never thought of the repercussions and consequences."

1739,"Yeah, it’s one thing when they’re fighting a rebel force or an insurgency where the current government is already at war with them."
1740,"UN cannot ""invade"" a country. UN troops are for peacekeeping operations only. 


In any full scale military conflict, there will definitely be casualties on both sides including civilians. Cities, infrastructures and economy were be destroyed. There will be lack of food, clean drinking water, medicine for the civilians. 

After the war, the rebuilding of the cities, infrastructures and economy will start and that will cost tons of money not to mentioned the money spend during during war. 

Take a leaf out of the Philippines and Indonesia's civilians uprising. They overthrow the regime of Suharto and Marcos. Same can also happen in Myanmar."
1741,"...because thats what invasions do? Look at literally any militant intervention done by the UN. Syria, Libya,  and since the USA would almost definitely be leading this invasion, we can look to North Korea which was bombed relentlessly by the UN, destorying 80% of infrastructure, in the name of overthrowing an authoritarian regime https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_North_Korea

Oh, and also, 1.5 Million Korean Citizen casualties. 

But I mean, hey, that literally North Korea, right? Well its hardly an outlier. 

Take Libya, when the UN overthrew their ""Authoritarian Leader"" they left anywhere from 50 to a few thousand dead, there isnt a true consensus. 

Or Laos, which, to this day, still has people dying from UN bombs which just didn't go off, and are detonated by accident when dug into by farmers. 
http://legaciesofwar.org/about-laos/secret-war-laos/

And I don't really have to go into the amount of casualties in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, in the name of Democratization, do I? 

The Military Junta and its leaders deserve to be put down, preferably in the cruelest fashion possible, and democracy must be restored. But it would be better for everyone if the UN provided food, water, medical equipment, and electricity generators, rather then bombs and corpses."
1742,The Junta has enough military power that a full fledged invasion of the country would be absolutely devastating.

1744,Democratisation was one of many goals of US and allied involvement in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was a failed state even before they shook it to the core.
1745,[deleted]
1746,Would it be possible for UN to supply arms for the people? They can take up arms and become militias
1747,"When in any of my comments said that the Tatmadaw is innocent?

Yes! The Burmese people are calling for help but do you see any help in the form of military intervention is coming from any foreign nations? 

UN's troops role is that of peacekeeping. Beside UN peacekeeping troops cannot be deploy because a number of member nations sees it as domestic issue and other countries like China with veto power had or will veto against any deployments.

The higher the hope/expectation, the bigger the disappointments if these hope/expectations are not fulfilled."
1748,"Actually, the Socialist Government propped up by the Soviets was doing some very impressive things, such as granting women equal rights, curbing terrorism, and building energy independence. It obviously wasmt perfect but it would've been intresting to see where that wouldve gone if the USA hadn't of intervened."
1749,"This an incredibly bleak and flawed look on society. Nations that arent messed with by Imperialist powers naturally progress toward democratization, South America has been doing this for years now. And these invasions, the ones that I spoke on, did they lead to democracy? Is North Korea, or Libya a functional democratic government? No! All we did was go in, blow up a bunch of people, and then leave! If that's decisiveness, if that's democracy, then I don't want it. 

Also have no clue what you mean when you say Democracy is on the downfall. South America, Africa,  and the middle east are actively becoming more democratic as time marchs forward. 

Tell me, can you name any UN military interventions that ended with a successful and flourishing democracy?"

1794,"Yeah seriously, I was just thinking I hope some people in this crowd have weapons because they are very much fighting to defend their lives and those of their comrades as much as their freedom! This can not end with the protestors continuously trying to maintain peace when they’re literally being gunned down."
1795,How about you inform me on the situation before I say some words that would probably get you mad. Please?
1796,"makes sense, the more the other dictators of the world can bring in more dictators and normalise it, the harder it will be to eradicate it from the world."
1797,Oh something's wrong .Thailand isn't support the military junta.
1798,I don't understand where you came from? I think I wasn't speaking to you.. I was replying to same Dull**** guy..
1799,"I'm not too sure about what you say. Maybe they're against the coup, but they are the biggest buyers of natural gas and money goes straight to Tatmadaw. They are also providing military trainings to juntas."
1800,"No need to down me, my guy. I asked please, to inform me on the situation. Wasn’t trying to make you mad or something."
1801,I understand. But the please is irrelevant if there's no connection with your message. You have two accounts or what's the deal?
1802,"My message was to say to please inform on the situation, as in a nice way of asking. No, I do not have two accounts, what makes you assume that?"
1803,"Okay, so, let's start fresh... i think I can be a bit nicer and I've seen your please before too. I removed the phrase that grinded your gears from the root comment.

The 2nd account, nevermind, some weird indentation glitch on my side. Screen too small. its alright now

My opinion is that i don't see much connection with USA, but I would like to hear your point here.

Regarding the military, I've got close friend there and watching daily and nightly shit that junta are doing, first hand news. HR violations, crimes, tortures, damage, celebrations and other inhuman animal disgusting stuff.... i haven't seen any burmese citizen commit a single mistake or hate act. Juntas are killing them, arresting them,beating them, everything, and i think it went too far. Those army and police are cowards and terrorists. Myanmar had already the first phase democracy, and juntas trying to illegally and unlawfully reverse it.... i think they should fight back.

Sorry quite busy lately, thus slow replies.

There are few smartasses in the group that would just not want to see what's happening and strongly defend the military like they're paid from them. How they can be so heartless I don't understand...."
1804,"This doesn't need to happen.

This whole fighting for power thing.

Legit we have so much technology to reach a post-scarcity economy and live a life of fully automated luxury and everyone can be happy."
1805,Hurts my heart to see Myanmar this way and no one stepping in to help.
1806,"The situation is messed up in so many levels. Never seen lives being so dispensable before. I'm based in Australia. Apart from money donation, are there any other ways that I can do anything, anything at all to help? Demonstrations, protests and such?"
1807,This is too sad :(
1808,Condolences.
1809,My heart broke seeing the photo
1810,"Fuck man, this got me :("
1811,"Tell that to the psychopaths so hungry for power their willing to damn their entire nation. The hard part about dealing with fascist autocrats now is the technology of mass surveillance, highly specialized and effective weapons, drones, and so many propaganda outlets to turn people against one another. Revolutions have never been easy, but these 1% rich pieces of shit have been moving chess pieces around for decades trying to figure out every way possible to build themselves into a paradise unreachable about the people that do the work to support their lifestyle. It’s pitiful to see the bootlickers make excuses for the filthiest rich people who have voted and supporter corrupting governments all around the world just so they can hoard even more wealth and look down on more plebes. I hope to see guillotines soon, as suffering and hell on earth won’t take much longer to show up if the people can’t wipe such a virus off the planet, United by a common cause."
1812,"The best way to help us is to stand up to injustice anywhere as much as you can. Together we can make this planet likable, livable and lovable again."
1813,I would like to know this as well. Myanmar was one of the most magical places I have ever visited and seeing this happen hurts my heart.
1814,"You can donate to CRPH, which is like the legitimate government. Hold on I'll find a link for you."
1815,Just check the subreddit pinned post. It's there
1816,What do the 3 fingers represent?
1817,"Those masks are beautifully done. So much somber, tragic symbolism packed into such a small canvas. Terrible that this is necessary."
1818,"Shame on the UN for capitulating to the CCP yet again. First the Uyghur genocide, then COVID now the coup in Myanmar.

Respect to these brave people"
1819,Heroes
1820,I hope Chinese people never have such a wicked devil to drive them out of their homes and shoot their own race.The world has lost it's nerve..No balls to do the right thing.Only when they know it's very safe and easy like desert storm.
1821,China is a big evil. keep out.
1822,"I'm talking about reasons to punish bad tyrant rulers.There is a huge difference between Iraq and Burma.
Iraq is mainly desert and Burma is green with jungle and high ridge hills.Usa doesn't go for difficult targets only easy ones.Vietnam was a fiasco. Lesson learned. And , North Korea will be soon in charge of it's own big firework soon.
Technology is fast changing demographics."
1823,"The free people of Myanmar is giving the slaved people of China revolutionary ideas and courage that they will need when revolutionary comes to China next.  

After this mess is over, US and EU and The Japanese would be invited to have friendly military bases in Myanmar along the Chinese border!"
1824,Cool!
1825,wait so what do you want China to do?
1826,"Honestly, you people of Mynanmar are pretty retarded. Let's be honest here. What is your deal with China? They were building factories in your country providing jobs? They don't want to get involved with the coup or anit-coup demonstrations? What do you want China to do? Great idea, let's pick a fight with a superpower bordering us. Your basically sowing the seeds of your own destruction."
1827,"Let tell you that you don't know much about me.Your comment is going to the wrong  person.I have travelled in China a few years ago, and met so many nice people. The problem lays with China (the authorities) needing friendly borders.But not at any cost."
1828,"arg, its turning sinophobe and with that, nationalistic again. next they will burn down the villages of some minorities. wouldn't be  the first time."
1829,"USA regime mouthpiece ""Radio Free Asia"" LMAO"
1830,That's why UN is unreliable. I hope US will create a NATO version in Pacific a more reliable than QUAD.
1831,Sign of protest
1832,Three fingers represent against the junta!
1833,"Civil disobedience movement.
If you see 3 fingers => those are good guys. Those that shoot, abduct, bodyopen and torture people showing 3 fingers are terrorists"
1834,Justice democracy and freedom
1835,"Well worded, exactly what I was thinking."
1836,They look like the purge masks
1837,"The UN didn’t capitulate to anything, it’s just how it works"
1838,"Desert storm was not about the people, it was about resource and market control"
1839,I think you don't know well about CHINA attitude towards Myanmar!
1840,"Yes, it's called Karma for the bamar who say iddly by while the rohingya were being massacred."
1841,[removed]
1842,Let China in so Myanmar can infect China with the freedom virus.  China needs a freedom revolution.
1843,Appreciate your comment 😊
1844,Just don't block our way! Ok?
1845,The whole world know what china is!
1846,Move out. Stop supporting the genocide in many ways. And stop eating dogs
1847,China needs a revolution.
1848,You're so outdated with info that you shouldn't be in this group
1849,"Member of the 50 cent army!  Revolution is coming to China soon so shut up and watch the free people of Myanmar fuck up a dictator.   

The Chinese people will learn revolutionary ideas and courage to fight the CCP when the time comes."
1850,"Who is causing sinophobia?
Who pretends the whole china sea as their?
Who is bullying neighbors countries?
Who is constructing dams along the Mekong, ruining other countries?
Who is acting like a bully in HK? In Taiwan?
Who is using slaves?
Who is acting like a fucking moron toward Myanmar?

No think again and tell me what causes the sinophobia"
1851,"CCP is causing sinophobe.  Since CCP is a$$hole, sinophobe is world wide.  CCP needs to be humbled a little. Lower their ego."
1852,regime? there are elections unlike the regime in china and russias completly false elections.
1853,US listens to UN
1854,"So it lets atrocities happen, what's the point then? Again and again. What do you mean that's how it works?"
1855,"Yes you forgot to mention with intention to gain extra oil reserves with force.
And in doing so ..on the second illegal invasion, caused a 7 year civil war and gave birth to muliple resistance/and ISL"
1856,Don’t need a newspaper to be anti China. Myanmar wouldn’t be where it is today without the involvement of China and it’s fucked up nationalistic policies. China would gladly watch the world burn if it meant they would be one yuan richer.
1857,"Wait so when the rohinga crisis was happening ,why was there no opposition to the China and russia vetoing the UNSC help in rohingya crisis?Where was the myanmar community helping to protect the rohingya people?

Isnt this karma?Why now ?"
1858,Hey that’s a good start.
1859,Consider this a warning.  Please don't use the negative stereotype of Chinese people eating dogs.
1860,Do I laugh....or cry...or both..🤔
1861,"if people in china have jobs and a roof over their head and are happy, why do they need a revolution?"
1862,Why don't you update me?
1863,Yeah you get to choose either Clown A or Clown B
1864,Not really.
1865,"It’s a unity of nations, it can only do so much independently, it more often than not needs unanimous support to actually act, and China is too influential"
1866,They look like inbreds.
1867,"Do these people have families, do they have homes, do they still sleep after doing all that?"
1868,Get together and fucking shoot them at every protest they show up at.
1869,"At this point we should just send ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the PLO after them. And maybe the South Vietnamese army as well."
1870,I wonder how the police and military would feel if someone killed their families the same way they kill peaceful protesters... So sad.
1871,Myanmar soldiers are crazy. Where're  your conscience ?
1872,"All the dumb shit heads are getting killed when facing people with guns who can fight back like the KIA.  When this is over a lot of them will be dead and they all die for a lie. 

Why are they wearing masks when they will be dead before covid gets to them?"
1873,"They grow up secluded in military compounds with heavy indoctrination and propaganda shoved down their throats. Their ""families"" and ""homes"" are each other, so they feel a certain type of safety, enough to play God. They still sleep, repeating in bed the phrase ""an order is an order."""
1874,"This could lead to worse things man, we talking their whole military that, unlike the civilian population, are heavily armed and have jets are their disposal, If they shot back im sure it would just give them the excuse to kill any civilian on sight..."
1875,Way way way way way easier said than done.
1876,"They want us to do that so that they can declare war on us civilians and close the country as an ""internal affair"""
1877,Lol
1878,South Vietnam Army after the U.S troops left and after the U.S getting a new general became very deadly.  Held their own until they ran out of ammo that the U.S promise but never delivered.  The ARVN will always be forgotten hero of Vietnam.
1879,"Not picking a side. 

Just wanted to note that they seem to already be shooting anyone and everyone on sight."
1880,What!!!! Why do you say lol??
1881,Hello interesting
1882,Yeah it sure as hell seems that way... But if that were the case there'd be many more dead
1883,"Some ppl have no sympathy, ignore them"
1884,"As someone who is uneducated on the subject, seeing someone call a group of people terrorists and then suggest they do terrorists acts is incredibly ironic"
1885,"Doug I just re-read what you wrote, are you comparing the ARVN (good guy) to Al Queda and Isis (bad guy)?"
1886,Terrorism is the act of acheving a goal though public fear and force. Self defence is stopping someone from gunning down you and your family by shooting back.
1887,One mans terrorist is another’s freedom fighter
1888,You may want to look up the definition of terrorism.
1889,No no no. I’m not trying to compare. I wasn’t thinking straight when I wrote it.
1890,You may want to look up the definition of perspective
1891,"Well at least you remember the South Vietnamese army, they are
forgotten soldiers.  Most people just think it was only the U.S fighting the enemy."
1892,"And how would that help? In all perspectives, your use of terrorism is incorrect."
1893,True.
1894,"This is real?
My god my heart aches. 

God speed you beautiful people"
1895,Please use NSFW tag
1896,Stay strong friends!
1897,Fuck sake
1898,This has a eerie similar feel to the 1965 Indonesian coup
1899,Is there _anything_ you can do against snipers? Maybe?
1900,"Lets pray for them. We have the most advanced military in the world with a force projection that has no limit but please by all means, lets sit in our house and hope things get better..."
1901,"This is so painful to see. I'm so sorry this is happening. Fuck the powerful. Fuck the soldiers ""just doing their jobs""."
1902,SAY NO TO COMMUNISM BACKED BY RUSSIA AND CHINA!!
1903,The Myanmar military is a brutal regime who can do anything. Anything at all. And get away with it or frame it on something else.
1904,This is real.Its happened today.They are real monsters.
1905,"Long story short, a fortune teller told the dictator Min Aung Hlaing that he will die by headshot, so he is killing protestors by headshot cos he thinks that will ""magically counter his fate"". More like making his fate come true."
1906,NSFL
1907,"Maybe regular sweeping with drones to surveil and look for them, but they tend to be good at hiding and don't need to be on a rooftop. Could be a window, anything. The sniper could be wearing urban camouflage to fit into cityscape or plainclothes to fit into crowd. They're likely protected by a small crew of soldiers/mercenaries strategically placed around them. Also likely that they will have secure transportation to and from the firing location.

If they're targeting people randomly, not much can be done. If they're targeting specific people, those people should try to be as unidentifiable and as difficult to locate as possible."
1908,We are not safe.They are monsters.
1909,Coming to America soon.
1910,"Reminds me somewhat of the Haitian dictator 'Papa Doc' who (though always sociopathic and ruthless) had a diabetic stroke of some sort, went into a coma, and had deteriorating mental faculties when he woke up. Began to take voodoo and the occult far more seriously and literally. Terrifying stuff."
1911,Any source on this? We can share this on /r/nottheonion if there's a credible source.
1912,Wym?
1913,If I didn't think we already live in a fairy tale...
1914,Fuck no. That is all.
1915,I saw what the fortune teller said on Facebook live.
1916,This is civil war. I said it last month. Too many good people die in vain. Heroes. Good soldiers. Juntas don't care about protests or human beings and they will unapologeticly claim that civilians are the ones who are destroying the country. More bloodbaths are coming. I'm not religous but everyone knows that there comes a time to talk to God. May the gods be with the people of Myanmar and guide them in this difficult time.
1917,This is a massacre.
1918,"I know exactly how it felt like Bago. The whole town will feel like evil spirit is coming from somewhere and that everyone is scared even to turn your light on. You know it is real because it can’t be everyone unreasonably scare for no reason. There must be something inhumane was done to someone and someone must have seen it to be speechless. If this is to be manipulated and fake, I wonder how could someone make it at such a large scale and to touch the deepest level of one’s fear. The next morning the whole city pretend it to be normal but everyone is watching their back no shop or anything open even street dogs are not on the street. Sad faces, stones to mark on the spot of fallen hero’s and bloody spots on the road. The streets are all clear for about a week until monks can mourn the loss of life’s. People are speechless and helpless waking up with mistrust and realization that could really happen in Myanmar. I am not someone easily afraid of anything tho."
1919,death toll in Bago is about 100
1920,Is there a twitter account covering myanmar civil war by any chance?
1921,Spread rumors that Myanmar found oil or is flirting with communism to get NATO to care.
1922,"We can bomb Syria, but we cant help out Myanmar IN SOME WAY? Even just more reporting on it in MSM would help.

#goals"
1923,the same reson why we didnt do shit about what ~happened~ in china
1924,Are those in the photo protesters or military personnel?
1925,We should create a fundraiser to by a nuke or something to destroy junta.
1926,We need to set up a safe zone ASAP
1927,Oh my God... no one dares to do anything
1928,This is getting worse...
1929,"We can we are simply too ignorant or too afraid to help. There are armies, their are weapons, there are even humans able to shut this down. Yet we live for money and exist for power. It is disappointing to see humanity stand for life and freedom as the rest of the world just ignores and watches. Excuse after excuse is laid and yet we still can not help humans fighting for freedoms name?"
1930,Aa I said in one of other Myanmar post's time for protesting has past a long time ago. Now it's time for action! I am sorry that you need to hear it this way but if you not start fighting soon more and more people will die and moral whit them.
1931,When humanity lose morality
1932,"Can you imagine what would happen to the junta if the protestors got hold of modern weapons and organised themselves.
All that anger would result in a blood-bath but this would be resolved finally.

I would imagine that China would then intervene as they wouldn’t want their true involvement to get out if the junta lost."
1933,Too bad they don’t have any oil.
1934,"Link to Radio free Asia story:

[Myanmar Junta Kills Scores of Protesters in Bago, Decrees Death Penalty for 19 in Yangon](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/bago-protesters-04092021192417.html)"
1935,Anyone who simps for China and says blocking international intervention is a good thing is someone who supports allowing this to happen...
1936,"Ah yeah, where were you when hyper nationalistic ""Buddhist""patriots were quietly supporting the genocide of 24,000 Rohingya and the ethnic cleansing of over a million innocent men women and children, eh? Now you know how it feels. Why should any westerner support people that have no respect or value the benefits of tolerance and ethnic diversity and embrace the values of such a society? Don't give me a reason cause you haven't got one except the innocent children that have not yet been corrupted by the communities that they depended on to teach them right from wrong and good from evil instead of infecting them with racial, ethnic and religious hatred, as you attempt to justify a genocide. That's not very Buddhist is it now. If you had stood up for the Royhinga perhaps the Tatmadaw wouldn't have become so empowered by your acceptance of such atrocities and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately it is now your innocent children that are going to be mentally scared by your ambivalence, disrespect and lack of empathy and abandonment of morals and ethics as you now become the victims of your fate."
1937,can we really consider china and russia backed military as civil?
1938,[deleted]
1939,Fuck(( I was hoping that there would be no second March 27.
1940,Try using the #WhatshappeninginMyanmar tag.

1942,"On top of what the other person said, they have a simple way to see current/old tweets.

Today will be #Apr11Coup"
1943,Myanmar does not line the pockets of the US politicians.
1944,Didn’t you hear? China said intervention would make everything worse and won’t let all the nations who condemned the coup do anything
1945,Protestors
1946,Using bottle rockets that would take a one in a million chance to kill anyone. Perfect for the military to be able to justify murdering them though. Despicable.
1947,"Come on over, there's a place for you up front"
1948,[deleted]
1949,gtfo of here you sack of absolute feces
1950,You are so brainwashed that I don’t even want to refute your bs
1951,that's like saying every German or Austrian is a Nazi because of the holocaust
1952,"Remember that gov =\= people , no people deserve what is happening now in Myanmar."
1953,"In fact, not all people are nationalistic as you think of. We condemn the Rohingya genocide as well. You seem to be brainwashed or maybe you're just an idiot."
1954,Yeah man... Who asked?
1955,No absolutly not. CivilWar as in country man vs country man.
1956,"Bad bot, not cool."
1957,[removed]
1958,"I was hoping for a professional profile covering the civil unrest. I follow Ethiopia Map and Blue Sauron (Ukraine) for their detailed coverage. I scrolled through the hashtag and no luck, if you or anyone reading this does find a profile like that please let me know, thank you."
1959,That's what I thought too.
1960,"That's the problem! The military will use the excuse of self defence and shoot back and the weapons the military are using, are more lethal and accurate then those used by these protesters."
1961,They are using firework.  Not exactly bottle rockets but yeah it is fked.
1962,If I had the money to travel that far and know the language and culture I would happily. Fight for freedom!
1963,O. Thx for the info. Didn’t mean to be ignorant but sometimes I am.
1964,"Well that's not the sort of bovine faeces i would expect to dribble out a Buddhists mouth. Your comment is exactly the same thing you said to the Royhinga as a million of them fled the genocide to Bangladesh. Isn't it now? Yeah. Denial certainly won't help you now, so spare your insults for someone else."
1965,"Didn't feel like it when Germany did it tho. Although I disagree, he has a point."
1966,"I read somewhere that armed rebels are joining the fray... fuck, no wonder."
1967,My heart aches to see them. 🥲
1968,How did they do that to her face!?!?!?!?
1969,"Please World, just wait a bit more to intervene"
1970,hope some armed protesters kill the terrorists
1971,:(
1972,How could that be? The evil junta (including that bloody serial killer Min Aung Hlaing) must PAY FOR THIS!
1973,"The people of Myanmar might have better success getting the world to act by digging for and finding some oil. What a f'ing tragedy and if you were ever on the fence about China before this, look no further than [their official stance](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55913947)."
1974,I wish I could travel there and assist you in your freedom.
1975,"Damn, didnt even want to think on what they did the them"
1976,"Why hasn't the Burmese gone out and start killing the soldiers? There are so many citizens, you can overwhelm them and take their weapons. The later fights will get easier. 

Is it because they are waiting for someone else to do the dirty work? Waiting for ethnic armed forces to do everything then take credit and betray them again? Waiting for foreigners to come die for them?"
1977,"Have you seen some of the videos leaking out of just how hard the officers beat people? Looks like their trying to kill them with ever swing, using guns, bats, etc etc. Despicable humans willing to maim and kill their neighbors and compatriots."
1978,[deleted]
1979,It will be like feeding buffet to them. They will just destroy the horde with automatic weapons and bombs. They won't hesitate to use tanks and airstrikes too.
1980,Soldiers have families.  Families can't be guarded 24/7.  Families make good leverage.
1981,"You are already taking 700+ casualties. Think of what you could have accomplished if those deaths were useful to kill or get weapons. They all died for nothing.

Also you don't have to fight them head on, do it at night. Attack places where they have very small number of soldiers. They set up check points, attack those and steal the guns. It get easier and you can start targeting police stations when you have enough guns.

At this point it looks like you guys are just waiting for someone else to do the work then take credit for it later. I mean it's already happening. People are talking about protesters that died as heroes and how they are buried at the grave ment for heroes. But zero post about soldiers from ethnic armed forces that died fighting the military recently. It kinda seems to me like you guys are going to stab us in the back again.

I'm pretty sure after getting what you guys want, your democracy, that you'll toss away us other ethnic people like garbage."
1982,"Your post suggested you are Myanmar and highly likely that you are not from majority Bama. You made a good point on fighting back. I think it is coming soon. People are realising peaceful protest alone doesn’t work. And finally it is OUR democracy, and we will leave no one behind on building our new federal democratic country. ✊"
1983,Your an ethnic armed forces member? Have an estimate on how many ethnic armed members have been lost thus far in fighting?
1984,"I think you're an ethnic person who is not a burmese. First, as a burmese, i'm really sorry for everything your people have to go through while we're living peacefully. Your comment is so damn true too. Maybe most burmese are affected by the fake democracy and easy livings for decades. That's why we become cowards and afraid of losing the things we own ( like our jobs, big shining cities, hotpots,etc.) while we're blinding to see the dark future. People dont even want to bang the pots now which is the easiest way of protesting.
I guess your people should retake your lands from MAL, get away from us and start building your own country. 

I'm really sorry, brother."
1985,"Why is this being downvoted, they are making a valid point."
1986,"I do see videos of some protesters in cities fighting back with home made weapons. Good for them. The issue is the rest isn't willing to follow up and support them.

While they're distracting the soldiers the other people could go around and flank the soldiers. So much missed opportunity. I think the real issue is not many are willing to kill someone."
1987,Yeah. Strange that people are ready to get killed but not so ready to kill their enemies. They must change that.
1988,"Is because it is easier to sacrifice yourself. This is justified and it is democratic.

However, forcing others to follow this sacrifice is no longer democratic and justified their actions. It has to be the majority that needs to wake up and see this Junta for what it really is."
1989,This generation is so smart & so brave!
1990,"u/savevideo

To all Myanmar citizens that see this, keep fighting. You have the world at your back. We are spreading your videos and pictures and we are spreading awareness. Keep fighting, stay strong"
1991,"Fucking A, these guys are brave. Why the fuck is the world not paying attention to this?"
1992,"The Burmese people *must* keep resisting because, unfortunately, help is not coming."
1993,People of Myanmar are superhumans
1994,Credit to Facebook page Three Fingers
1995,"I think the generals have a real problem on their hands. This is not going anything at all like they thought. The country is shut down. No infrastructure is operating. The Civil Disobedience Movement has gained full support of all areas and professions. 

With 54 million people, you cannot kill everyone. The people are not going to be intimidated by the murders. To the contrary, they will not let their heroic losses be in vain. Now WTF is general 19th century going to do? He is in a battle of wits and getting outplayed."
1996,"I promise you this

As an american if I somehow make millions of dollars I will buy as much guns as I can and bring it to your country.  I promise"
1997,"We are still protesting against this brutal juntas.They are killing us every day and night.Though They ban social media we are using VPN to spread news and our voices.We are so thankful for hearing our voices.We appreciate your attention,praying and supporting for us.We are so exhausted but we must keep resisting and we are doing.Thank you all around the world who are standing with us🙏"
1998,You are real hero. Respect !
1999,"Protesting won't do anything.

They need to FIGHT. 

Use the American revolution as a perfect example. 

The boston massace, the revolutionary war...

Myanmar needs to fight for their freedom, otherwise it's just going to get worse"
2000,"Maybe it’s naive to think they’ll succeed; however, this is a chance to set a precedent that authoritarians cannot just take power via lies and terrorism and that the public will fight back."
2001,"Where was this passion for justice during the Rohingya Genocide?  


I hope the people of Myanmar win this fight and win their freedom, but I also hope they can self reflect on their silence as the military murdered and raped the Rohingya.   


If you don't stand up for one peoples rights, then you will lose your own rights. The fact that the military is doing what they are doing now is because the people did not stand up for the Rohingya. You made the current situation possible by your silence."
2002,black block yourselves please!!
2003,Brave brave people! Stay strong myanmar! ❤

2005,cause we're selfish and unable to give more than we give ourselves.
2006,Email your senators about the issue
2007,"They don't have guns. They have numbers, courage and creativity. The generals live in the 19th century. Time to go."
2008,Do you feel like you’re a moral person using people’s suffering to try to lecture while not understanding the situation at all? Ignorant
2009,They can overwhelm small groups of cops and military to obtain guns. That's the best best to start the revolution
2010,"We can all learn different lessons at different times in our lives. Often when we go through a struggle it helps us to be more empathetic to other peoples struggles.

This is a good time for the people of Myanmar to reflect on the Rohingya Genocide, now that they are experiencing something similar."
2011,What is happening in Myanmar is very alarming
2012,it is alarming that myanmar is turning to next syria
2013,"I believe these kids are from medical based camp in San Chaung tsp. Now military just arrest whoever they want. Junta's ugly pileholes always mentioning ""According to law"", In reality, they are the ones who keep breaking it and conduct illegal activities. Getting so sick of it."
2014,What can we do to help them?
2015,"China has blood on its hand supporting this murderous military terrorists. 
China suck ass and CCP is just a party of cowardice cunts. Same for the military terrorists. Fucking cunts.

Ayay Taw Pone Mu Cha Aung Yah Myi!!!!"
2016,what a terrible news
2017,this city is shit
2018,China has so much to answer for. We're still waiting for them to explain covid FFS!!!
2019,We hope they are released soon! Protestors should be treated no matter what.
2020,Your military regime is way beyond crazy. What does the population opinion look like right now? Is there a fraction that supports the regime?
2021,Praying for them 🙏
2022,"I don't know why the UN, EU and other domestic countries still turn a blind eye to the happenings in Myanmar? God, pls help and save the brave and innocent Myanmar people."
2023,At least in Syria the rebels have weapons to fight back with. We have nothing here
2024,Uncle plz more speaking out. I m with u from mm near ur home. Plz smthing special uncle.
2025,Sounds like China these last 100 years. Fuck the CCP. They're nothing but evil.
2026,"haha sorry, I am not that superstar who lives near your home. if I were, how could I post stuff here on Reddit from jail."
2027,"Even though I'm not in Myanmar nor do I know anyone there personally, and even though everyone there is a stranger to me, I'm so goddamn proud of each and every single protester who is out there fighting for your country, each and every person who hasn't given up hope, each and every person who will not go down without a fight, and each and every person who has endured all of this madness and sacrificed so much, you all have my respect. I truly hope you get your country back, and well done for not giving up."
2028,[removed]
2029,"For those who are viewing these pictures in another country. These protesters are not only fighting for their freedom and democracy but they’re doing it in temperatures close or above 40c!!! 

Respect to all of you for your shear courage, bravery and determination. God bless you all and Burma in that you will reach your goal very soon. Keep fighting!!! 👍🙏🙇‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏿‍♀️🙇🙇🏻🙇🏿"
2030,If only Myanmar invaded some other country. As a German this seems to be the only missing part that differentiates this from the third reich
2031,Wait are these protesters or police? I can’t tell lol.
2032,Now we need some people to bring them or teach them how to build/3d print or deliver them some guns and ammo and supplies to help them out.
2033,Hell yeah! Proud of you guys and girls!
2034,Are these guys armed? I can't tell
2035,The division looking mad real now.
2036,These looks like fashioned after hong kong protesters ...unfortunately the myanmar military is not using tear gas ...they r using real bullets......
2037,Well done guys! You were awesome!
2038,"You guys rocks.
Praying for your country."
2039,Get these boys some guns and a beer each
2040,Every revolution from corruption should be celebrated!!!!
2041,"Unfortunately, ammos going to be an issue. Not that we would have many 3D printers to begin with."
2042,"If they have fireworks and pipe they can make matchlock blunderbusses, or hand light with a match, or literally just stick the firework fuse in and light it. Rocks, ball bearings etc. can be used as ammo, and torn up clothes or plants for wadding. Sure, they aren't really a match for the military's modern arms, but they're a helluva lot better than Roman candles"

2044,"Oh, the night raids certainly has a Gestapo feel. Yet, they preach on and on about 'disciplined democracy'. Lying through their teeth, another similarity."
2045,Nope. We wish we’re armed
2046,"That's true, I absolutely agree with you on that one."
2047,Join the military as a spy
2048,[deleted]
2049,Fortunately reloading equipment is available. Very easy to manufacture common ammunition at home. Typical setup to get started can be had for under $300.
2050,"There is no such thing as disciplined democracy. There is only disciplining the ones in power through direct democracy.

I hope the revolution won’t be too bloody and that it will change your country for the better!"
2051,"Saw a video of some protesters using molotovs and Roman candles earlier, if you have fireworks black powder weapons can be made. They won't be terribly effective past about 40 meters, but that's far better than fireworks in my opinion. The plus side is as long as you have powder a muzzle loaded shotgun can shoot just about anything, rocks, ball bearings, etc., and use fabric or even plant leaves or brush as wadding. Proper lead shot and purpose made wads are preferable, but might be hard to come by. Improvised ammo can limit range by quite a bit because of lower density, and less consistent patterns. 

Important note: do not use smokeless powder, it may cause improvised weapons to explode, and try to concoct a safe loading before you use it"
2052,"🤣🤣🤣

And what? Make off with a trainload of guns and ammo? At the risk of being hated by the entire country?"
2053,"3D-printer metal ammo? Can it shoot through body armour? How about gunpowder? Or is it propelled in some other manner?

(Uh, oh. Internet's gonna be cutoff again in 10 minutes.)"
2054,Assasinate the general maybe

2056,"A cartridge consists of just 4 parts that are all likely easily accessible if you know where to look - the casing, the bullet, the propellant / powder, and the primer. 

The bullet can even be cast at home by melting down the lead weights used to balance car wheels or lead pipes."
2057,"🤣😂🤣😂

Have you seen him in the state comedy broadcasts? He gets older day by day. He's just going to drop dead from self-inflicted stress."
2058,"Well, if anything, armed ethnic armies may be involved soon. So, on that front, I doubt we going to be needing 3D-printed guns if we might be just handed some weapons.

(2 minutes from internet cutoff. Fuck you, junta!)"
2059,Holy shit. I loved Myanmar and the people on both my trips there. Can’t believe I’m reading this stuff.
2060,"These animals will pay a price, dont worry! Karma welcomes them soon."
2061,When did this happen? Where can I read about this?
2062,"Looking at that illustration honestly made me cry, I hope this ends soon for those who live and are being affected by this."
2063,Pure barbarism
2064,"I hoped it would get better, but I'm losing hope in this whole thing having a ""happy"" ending just by peacefully protesting. These murderers are seriously capable of killing all the country's citizens if things continue in the same way. Stay strong!"
2065,Can the U.N. fucking do something?
2066,This angers me at a whole different level
2067,"damn, a double homicide..."
2068,"This is awful, I hope justice is served for all the people of Myanmar one day."
2069,"it is really perplexing why the soldiers are following such murderous instructions from the army ?  brain-washed ?  it seems so easy for them to shoot live rounds at women, children, citizens .....this is unthinkable and UN say what ??"
2070,"Has anyone in the world woke up and noticed that peaceful protests never work and never will. If you want change you have to make change. Start arming yourselves and fighting back guerilla style. Look at Hong Kong, united states, England, Lebanon, Senegal, Iran, Saudi Arabia, India, Maldives, and about 70 other countries. The governments will oppress you and wait you out until protesters tire and dissipate. 6 months from now Myanmar will be back to killing rohingya and the chins again. Remember after world War 2, ""Never again""? Well we are at about 95 + genocides since then and no one does anything. This world is gross and humans are a blight."
2071,Down with fascist juntas
2072,History tells us this will not end well for the Juntas. Stay strong out there everyone.
2073,This is why you don’t give up your right to own a weapon
2074,Fuck...
2075,Freedom is not free and no one will pay for your freedom.  Myanmar! This is not a protest. This is survival and resisting an invasion.
2076,"Reminds me of when the civil war happened in my country, it resulted in a heavy militiazation of Syria with Jihadists poping up everywhere a crime happened and outsiders (USA, Russia, Iran, Iraq etc) joining the game, war was very brutal, our house was destroyed with everything around it."
2077,They are less than animals. They are evil personified.
2078,"Myanmar Terrorists , military killed a Pregnant Woman as she hide protesters at her house. She got headshot on Mar 13 at her house and the protesters also are arrested brutally."

2080,Is that a rhetorical question? The U.N. Is as useless as it is corrupt sadly.
2081,"The UN is useless, basically just a giant tea party get together"
2082,"The UN, in particular the General Assembly and Security Council, is not a organisation above sovereign states. It is made up of sovereign states and hence the actions of the UN has to be agreed upon by the states.

UN Peacekeeping forces are only deployed if all parties in a conflict agrees to it. It has been that way since its founding.

The UNSC could allow military action on Myanmar military but that’s not an option when there is no viable solution out of that path. The last thing Myanmar, or Asia, or the world needs is another Iraq or Syria."
2083,"From what I've read, no, they won't. Their votes are compromised by China, Russia, India and Vietnam to name a few. Sadly, nobody is coming to help.

When the police are judge, jury and executioner like this they're no longer police. They're a firing squad. The people are being massacred one by one. Protesting and passivism won't win the day when the other side has the sole, unchecked power to commit violent acts."
2084,"The UN appointed China to the human right council panel, if anything they’ll just give the military a medal to “deescalate”"
2085,The UN is useless when it comes to stopping atrocities like this
2086,The UN has and never will be anything above a front for countries to feel better about themselves
2087,That is so iNsAnE and sad. I CANNOT even imagine the pain n suffering u went thru. It's AMAZING you're alive and I'm glad for that but Man. Holy shit I'm so sorry!! But happy u made it thru! Says a LOT about how strong you are. So you're PURE Awesome!
2088,"Thats possible, an Alternative would be...

And this is my suggestion; ( Get ""Lazy"", Do the least amount of effort to get the most effect out of it)

[1) David Vs Goliath](https://youtu.be/7zLAcUZkxHA)

See, far less ""body count"". Of course dont take the story out of context, I am not asking you to start killing people.

[2) Why Batman is the Best Super Hero](https://youtu.be/b4lRkI2ScuA)

Hope you get the *spirit* of what I am trying to say.
Self defence helps. Sometimes you gotta learn to **disarm** the situation. If the whole crazy situation is base on a lie, bring the truth. I mean if I was living in truth, I would reason and show proof instead of forcing my ""perspective"" on others, especially from the barrel of the gun, especially if I am suppose to show ""leadership"". Any nuttcase can take a life, it takes a true Human Being to save one. In more ways than one.

I mean Batman sends them to Arkham (Therapy) and maybe an extended hospital stay sometimes. 😅

[3) Become Batman Citizens, snap the military and police out of their crazy (I am Batman Hishe).](https://youtu.be/iXl7jf-zO-s)

Get weird among other methods, sometimes humour and critical thinking helps snap people back to reality, and not drag them into some ""leaders"" crazy view of the world. Especially the military and the police. Right now they are caught up in some ""leaders"" alternate universe where they are the heroes of their story."
2089,"Questions,  does a lot of Arabic people think that what is happening now is justified because the majority of the people in Myanmar didn't condemned as loudly as they are doing now when Rohingya genocide was happening?"
2090,"China, Russia, and many countries have been quite against military intervention after the US and NATO’s actions in Syria and Libya. The Security Council approved military action in Libya in the name of R2P. But the US went beyond the mandate of force only to protect civillians and started attacking Gaddafi to install a government of their preference. 

Ever since then the Security Council has been cautious of allowing actions in the name of R2P or humanitarian intervention."
2091,Fuck.. wherever China has their Fucking grummy hands only bad shit happens!
2092,"The UN doesn’t appoint members of the UNHCR Executive Committee. The members are rotated to ensure equal geographic representation. That means that most of the time you’ll have less than stellar countries like China, UAE, Venezuela, etc. on the committee. 

That’s the UN in general. It’s meant to force countries talk, instead of shooting at each other. Sidelining any country, a major power in particular, goes against the UN’s objective."
2093,Hard to believe there are people hoping US military to come to their country. I understand currently the situation is brutal but the Myanmar people need to fight yourself. Revolution comes with blood but that is the cost you have to pay to overthrow the junta.
2094,"They are understandably desperate and the US has quite successfully sold itself to the less-informed as “liberators”, but anyone who understands America’s foreign policy knows they aren’t the shining star.

You’re right, they’ll have to fight their way out of it. I fear that it is no easy or fast path out. Myanmar is somewhat like Iraq. The country has many ethnic groups willing to take up arms to fight each other, but they were held down by the junta. Take out the junta by force, and the country could easily spiral into a full blown insurgency/civil war, just like Iraq did after Saddam Hussein was removed."
2095,There is no easy revolution in history. Junta will fight hard to protect themselves. I can imagine what people will do to them if they lose the power.

2097,What are the life jackets for?
2098,I really want to go and protest but my dad won’t let me 😔
2099,I hope the military can defeat these anti-Buddhist Protestant monsters. The West will back them with their usual lies about Human Rights.
2100,First They came for rohingyas but I didn't speak because i was not a rohingya.........
2101,[removed]
2102,Thank you for telling it.We are spreading the news as much as we can.
2103,"(In the Netherlands) the nos(main news anchor) has said some things about it, such as the protests themselves once, and about the shooting, but nothing more"
2104,"For our safety because Myanmar Junta's  SAC crackdown violently the peaceful protesting crowd with water canon, smoke bombs and tears gas"
2105,Myanmar Military use water canon in some places and maybe life jackets make less painful i guess.
2106,"The life jacket covers your upper body so when the militaries try shooting you, you won’t get injured
It’s basically an upper armory"
2107,don't be sad.At Least you can spread the news of animals(Junta terrorists) terrorizing our citizens.Let the world know how cruel they are😉
2108,The Burma people spoke in 1988 and in 2007. They were massacred. Its not Nazi Germany. Its an authoritarian state that has existed for over 50 years. Learn the history. What's happening now and in the past.

2111,"I hope you're referring to rubber bullets. These won't slow down a real bullet, please don't let it give you a false sense of comfort."
2112,because these protesters will lead to civil war

We, the citizens of myanmar will show you"

2117,Awesome! More and more high ranking officers are joining!!
2118,"Good for him.  

Better to join CDM now.  Eventually this thing is going to go full on Robespierre, and they will be using bodies of higher ranking officers to block the armored vehicles."
2119,"Thank God for you, stay safe please."
2120,nice
2121,"Good, nothing will happen without the support of officials"
2122,"Sorry for my ignorance and sheer stupidity, but what’s up with the Boy Scout symbolism with the protests. Nothing against it, fuck the military coup, just wondering why they’re doing the scout sign."
2123,A few good men.
2124,respect 😢
2125,All countries and UN not only condemn the Myanmar military. Pls take action to save the poor and brave Myanmar people.

2127,It's like the workout video never happened
2128,I wish I wasn't helpless and could actually do something. I am posting pictures and facts on facebook about what is happening to raise awareness.... Unfortunately that is all I can really do.
2129,"The United States was in a war in Burma from 1944-45. Burma was very divided. Some supported Japan to help kick out the British. Others opposed Japanese occupation. The fighting was savage. 

Every US intervention since 1945 has resulted in almost universal condemnation domestically and abroad. 

I served in Bosnia and OIF. Some muslims thanked me in Bosnia. The Marsh people in Southern Iraq thanked us. Everyone else hated us.

We risk war with China if we go into Burma and it could create a three-way war with India and destabilize Southeast Asia.

Diplomacy is more effective. Our ‘savage wars of peace’ have been a complete disaster. It looks a lot different when you are on the ground overseas."
2130,"Sorry, I ain't an arms dealer if I were I would definitely be trying to help better arm the Indigenous rebel groups."
2131,“the world is watching” UN said in a statement. Yes literally watching.
2132,Damn
2133,"What would you have the west do about Burma? Like, what reasonable solutions do you propose? I ask this with the utmost sincerity."
2134,"Well the UN failed the first test,no resolution can be passed in the security council which means no country can intervene in myanmar.

Secondly, you have a military junta which is armed with tanks and fighter jets plus artillery.Removing the junta requires a army stronger or the same to defeat the junta.Even if a country wants to send troops in myanmar, it means a declaration of war. Due to myanmar being a close proximity with China, China would not sit back either .Now you have a proxy war.

Thirdly,countries are struggling with covid -19 which is a more pressing matter domestically that takes greater precedence than myanmar which is a country that they may not have much relations with.

Fourthly,more  sanctions against the junta may not necessarily work. It is only the western side that is putting forth sanctions. However, Asean with its policy of non- interference would not put any sanctions forth. Even if the Asean decided to put sanctions on myanmar,they would be just pushing the junta closer to China.

Hence, the international community can only watch and condemn."
2135,Oof. Bruh. Bapyitloleh
2136,"the class I’m in had a full debate about wether or not we should intervene, everyone except for me and one other guy said we should not intervene because “it’s not our business” and other stupid shit like that, I’m seeing that that’s a common view around here :/"

2139,what a fucking black mirror episode of a world we live in
2140,"The British Burma army was  composed almost entirely of Karen, Kachin, and Chins and they fought Japanese from start to end. 

The Burmese resistance led by Aung San invited the Japanese to oust the British and then betrayed them. This group later approriated Myanmar's military and have almost nothing to do with Burma military during and pre-WW2"
2141,"Unfortunately most people especially the Burmese don't see it that way.

I can understand that the Burmese are desperate for help from the foreign nations but they don't see the consequences and repercussions of a foreign nation sending its troops into Myanmar.

Three major reasons of not sending troops are :-

1. The conflict can escalate into a military confrontation with China or Russia which might eventually lead to WW3.
2. There is nothing much to gain but more to lose. 
3. The World is suffering from a worldwide pandemic, war will costs a ton of money. The various nations' priority are with its own citizens and not the citizens of a foreign sovereign country."
2142,"I have respect for you, mister sane former US soldier."
2143,"1. Sanction foreign (including western and Chinese) multi national companies who hand cash to the junta like Chevron, Total, and ANZ.  E.g. With one stroke of a pen, the USA Secretary of treasury could bankrupt ANZ.  

2. Recognize NUG as the lawful government of Burma.  Turn over all the embassies and consulates of Burma to NUG. 

3. Set up a no fly zone in Burma.  

4. Share satellite telemetry of junta army positions with the Federal Army 

5. Blockade Burma’s ports so that all Burmese naval vessels at sea are stranded until they surrender to the Federal Army and no naval vessels leave port unless under NUG flag.  

Not a single western boot needs to touch ground in Burma.  Nor should a single western boot go there."
2144,I think OP is just expressing what it feels like. Burmese barely have the right to do even do that right now
2145,Write your reps and raise awareness. That's what you can do without other tools at your disposal
2146,But man we spend so much on having a fat cock for a military that we call the army of the free world can we not just shove it down some actual baddies throats for once?
2147,May I know the average age of your class?
2148,I think people still get it...
2149,"I had many good conversations with Muslims, Chaldeans, Orthodox, Catholics, Arab Socialists...

Mostar for example was a beautiful multi-cultural artists’ colony that was divided and destroyed for no apparent reason other than the political aims of a few.

Most people are just human beings trying to exist and raise families. 

They surprisingly didn’t view America particularly as the enemy, but rather corruption within their own societies as the main problem. The same problem we now have here...

Now in the American Cowboy gangster tradition; if you slap me, I’m gonna slap you back, but it’s a better world if we all just reason with one another and try to understand one another."
2150,[deleted]
2151,"I wish I could help. I know US has already put many sanctions against Myanmar military and companies doing business with the Myanmar military are being taken out of the stock exchange. Not realistic to put sanctions on China as China isn’t directly causing the coup and possibly a bigger reason could be that it would hurt the US economy. Any physical interruption/interaction with the Myanmar army will most likely lead to war. This makes me wonder how likely is the US willing to go to war for Myanmar. How can they justify the cost of deploying military assets and risking American lives? I’d like to hear someone else’s thoughts on this as well.
As an outsider looking at what’s going on, I really hope people could prioritize peace over democracy at this point. Is there anything that can be done to deescalate the situation with the military? If this means to stop the protests to save young lives, I’d agree with doing so. I am doing my best to spread the news as much as I can my friend."
2152,These actions are as good as a declaration of war.
2153,sanctioning companies simply for doing *any* business with the military would be a great idea; they would in turn apply their own pressure to the military
2154,"1. Pffft yeah right. That would be extremely expensive and costly for US government, people could lose jobs! I mean, why let good honest hard working American lose their jobs just to make sure some jungle people lose their lives amirite? 

2. Pffft yeah right. Turn over embassies to the ""government"" that has no power in its own country? What next? Recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state? 

3/5. Pffft yeah right. Such things require deployment of US navy'a fleets all around the Indian ocean. Imagine the headline! ""Another democrat president getting ready for foreign war"". Muh popular vote would suffer from it! 

4. And how much are you willing to pay? I heard you jungle people have a lot of gemstones? 

6. Not to mention, China. Do you really think we'd risk billion of dollars just for you jungle people? Yeah, right. 

This is satire of US' government view on Myanmar's coup."
2155,Open war is never a good solution. You know that the population would probably suffer even worse and millions would be killed in the process. If China intervenes you looking at a third world war in a nuclear age.
2156,"Hey dude. Some people gotta corrupt. You really think funding the education system is a good thing? They'd get smarter these socialists! Just look at Soviet, what drove them into collapse? Education! Gotta keep the oligarch afloat  somehow you know..."
2157,"15-16, we are all stupid as hell though lol"
2158,Saying you don’t neeeed the popcorn for us to get that popcorn is implied.
2159,"> You realize that it would mean going to war with myanmar?

If an ant wages war with an elephant does an elephant notice?

USA didn’t notice when Serbia went to war with USA.  

> Now. Suppose we do. Junta collapses, kills aung sang. Who will lead this free govt?

It won’t be any worse.  

“Democracy yashi ye! Do he! Do he!”

Or: https://youtu.be/wld5ImqcZlA

I doubt it will lead to a dictatorship

Aung San is already dead.  He was killed in 1947.  


>. Chinese vassal as to survive from bankruptcy from post war years. So we fight she gives the country over to China.

If ASSK makes Burma a vassal, she will unite the entire country of Burma. Against her.  Have  you spent any time with Burmese people since February 1? Burmese hate China.  

> What do we gain? Lots of your country men are dead,

Not a single American will die."
2160,No one's asking the US to sanction China. Just telling Chervron and Total to stop doing business with MAH would be enough..not that hard is it if they want to do it?
2161,">  Not realistic to put sanctions on China 

I did not propose sanctions on China

> China isn’t directly causing the coup a

I disagree. And more importantly, Burmese disagree.  

> Any physical interruption/interaction with the Myanmar army will most likely lead to war. 

Bring it

> How can they justify the cost of deploying military assets 

Because the USA can

> risking American lives? 

What risk to American lives?"
2162,Boo hoo. Declaration of war from a regime worse that Serbia.  Which got their azz handed to them.
2163,We’ve found the CCP representative

2165,"1. So is the Paris accord.  And yet Biden is going through with it. 

2. Indeed the USA has been inching toward recognizing Taiwan.  

3. The fleet is always in the Indian Ocean.  Didn’t you watch top gun?

4. I’m American.  Why would I charge Burmese guerrills money for satellite images.  What an inane response"
2166,"What do you mean, 'satire' ?"
2167,I mean I’m liable to die soon anyway lets have some fun and get drafted
2168,Yeah but if we gotta be corrupt can we at least play with the toys we buy?
2169,"All of you are not stupid, just that most of those in this age group are not matured and experienced enough to know the World's politics is not as simple as that.

Most of your class are still relatively young and don't understand the possible consequences and repercussions of sending troops.

I would also would want my country to send troops if I were their age."
2170,"Sure but they’re sharing it with you, not asking for how you’d make it/make it better/your criticisms"
2171,Yeah I agree. Companies doing business with Myanmar army should be penalized. It looks like they are already facing the scrutiny which is a great thing. Hope this continues with all companies doing business with the Myanmar military.
2172,Can you please tell me more on why Burmese think China is responsible somehow? I just never thought that China had anything to do with this. Thanks in advance.
2173,You think China would stand by? You looking at a worldwar in a nuclear age. You also realize that millions of the population would die in Myanmar regardless if China intervenes. War is not a solution ever.
2174,Maaaaald booooiiii your government wont do jackshit
2175,Ooof someone got triggered lol
2176,"Basically that's what the actual US government stance is, albeit a little bit (i wonder) hyperbolic."
2177,Was this said by the military or the police?
2178,"Use bycicles tied to firework bazzokas and next time they come round set a barricade and leave. They will be confused why no one is there then use Vietnam stradegies and jump on them. Fire fireworks, molotovs and vinegar bombs at them. Call it Operation Pounce"
2179,"I wrote my congresswoman today, I'm with you Myanmar, I wish there was more I could do, no one should have to experience the pain and fear that the Junta is putting on you."
2180,"This is one of those time a few drone strike on military compounds would be greatly appreciated. Take out their weapons storage facilities, military bases, and supply routes."
2181,Where and why is it blurred
2182,"Fire is your friend, burn everything the government has.sooner or later they will have nothing left."
2183,"This makes me so angry. I am so sorry for all you have to suffer and endure, my heart goes out to you and to any who are being oppressed."
2184,"Classy.

I thought a military was supposed to protect its people."
2185,u/savevideo
2186,Isn't collective punishment an actual war crime?
2187,Find whomever said it and put up a barricade on the street where he lives.
2188,"This means blocking the street is effective, keep blocking it!"
2189,[removed]
2190,I cannot play this. What is on the video?
2191,Writing my congressman/representative about Myanmar is onw if my high priorities right now. Hopefully I can remember to do so later.
2192,What can I do to help?
2193,Terrorist in motion.
2194,"Well, did you guys listen or what? Did you stop blocking the street?"
2195,Who are these absolute fucking scum? Jesus Christ.
2196,"Make traps on those barricades. Bear trap, rat trap, anything. They'll think twice before crossing."
2197,I think they can’t even read what we said. There is no such a military in the world who are against people of its own. Military doesn’t even shoot civilians and medics in the battle fields of world war. Once you point your gun towards you are no longer a soldier.
2198,"not sure btw by this point, we can't tell since soldiers are sometimes dressed in police clothing or even in civilian clothing."
2199,Head of police chief is appointed by General. And most of the higher ranking police figures are from Military. Real police man can't advance to these positions. Basically they are the same.
2200,Police take order from army. So it doesn’t really matter. Some police fled to India border town as they can’t carry out the order of killing their own people.
2201,"doesn’t really matter, now they are basically one and the same"
2202,"Military Junta. Those murderers responsible for a long string of genocides against the people of Myanmar. They must PAY for all this! By that, the world means NOW!"
2203,The Tatmadaw
2204,alrightyy. will inform ppl.
2205,"From the same people who brought you Home Alone and The Goonies, be prepared for family fun this summer with Adventure in Myramar."
2206,"Agreed, time to even the playing field.  I would add weapon drops also."
2207,Thanks Dear. Please help us and we appreciate you any means of helps.
2208,Thank you!
2209,A military strike is much appreciated and needed
2210,It seems this would be fair and proportionate at this stage.
2211,In North Okkapala. Sent from a friend in that area.
2212,so as not to identify exact location
2213,You’re too late to say that

2227,This is unverified it is from Elon Musk but I will leave it up here.
2228,I know the OP through a mutual friend. He works at Tesla so I’m sure it’s legit.
2229,[This link no longer works and it probably wasn't orginal source but I leave it anyway.](https://twitter.com/SaveMyanmar990/status/1379069024802381827)
2230,Elon Musk is not Tony Stark. He's not going to save anybody.
2231,No please... This is like joking to the greatest Burmese people. Who would believe that?
2232,"I think Elon could easily help Myanmar but getting that equipment into the country is probably the biggest hurdle.  Military would just put a bullet through the antennae if they discovered one out there.

Starlink is definitely legit snd will change the world and the internet as we know it."
2233,The rule in America is you can do whatever you want until the government says you can’t; that’s how American laws work. And that’s why we (for the most part) “are free.” If you want to do it - then do it ... you don’t need the governments permission. You only can not do it when they say it’s been made illegal. .... that’s the fundamental aspect of having a constitution and a free society..... so yeah .. I call BS on Elon Musk .... I hope he proves me wrong ....
2234,Doubt this will happen. Don’t forget that Elon Musk supported a Non-Democratic coup in Bolivia to keep lithium prices low.
2235,This is awesome news if Musk is willing to help our country.
2236,Too suspicious
2237,They advertise their package plan at Myanmar since January and the cost will be 99USD per month but the service will be available at 2022. Even only preorder isn't sure for now.
2238,"If Elon Musk says he'll help, that means he'll never help. He's a narcissistic billionarie. He doesn't give a shit about the people in his own country, let alone people in a country he probably can't even point to on a map."
2239,BIG PAPA ELON
2240,"I mean, sorry to burst your bubble guys, but that's just bullshit, either this email is fake, or if it isn't, it's just Musk advertising himself and growing his litteral personality cult. Every time Musk promises to help, turns out everything was just lies... So sorry, but this is just a false hope"
2241,Haha come on
2242,Yea... ok
2243,Yeah he’s not helping unless it makes him money
2244,"Do you know what else is important we know from this screenshot? Mask's email address. I google it and it is mentioned only a few times, it looks like it is his email."
2245,Pretty sure today’s not 1st of April
2246,it’s real . The one who sent the mail works at Tesla
2247,“We will coup whoever we want”-Elon Musk
2248,Oh my gosh really!!!! Yayyayyay
2249,Come on Elon you can do it
2250,"Okay, right now, I do not believe that this is true."
2251,"If he gave a shit about people, he wouldn't be manufacturing his cars in China"
2252,Isn't that like $90 a month?
2253,"Musk you big spender, spend some money on veteran's hospitals and inner city infrastructure."
2254,"Can I have the link of the twitter? Couldn´t find this post on his wall. I could have missed it. But hell yeah, Burmese people can pay for the internet."
2255,"The email address looks like it may be his. We may send him a letter or two. Just not too much, we do not want to piss him off."
2256,Should I flair it as possibly fake?
2257,Elon has a history of doing what those in power will not. I would hold my breath on this one.
2258,Thank you for this comment!
2259,His network is literally floating above their country as we speak
2260,Imagine if Elon sends in AI sentinels to Myanmar to help the protesters.
2261,"Get it to Kanchanaburi and I can get it in. I got 140 rattan chairs from Ikea into the country. Needed then on short notice after our Myanmar supplier cancelled our order a week before our big grand opening. No one in Myanmar could fulfill an order that large on such short notice. Thankfully, Ikea could, and they were right over in Bangkok. 

Problem was, import tax on rattan furniture of really high in Myanmar, to help the local producers. These chairs were already twice the cost of our original order, and all the import shit would have added another 40% to that. So we made some arrangements with a driver and gave him plenty of gifts in beer, cigarettes and whiskey to give to the border guards at one of the most remote border crossings where they can't just go by that stuff during their lunch break, these guys only go home once a week. That was that.

140 chairs arrived as if they were purchased right in town. I can get the equipment in. 

Unfortunately the military just outlawed satellite dishes though, so placement once in the country is more the issue then getting them in."
2262,And he uses child labor in the Congo.
2263,when did that happen?
2264,"That was a business decision which provided a financial benefit. 

This similarly, could be a business decision which provides a financial benefit.

The Bolivian situation was slightly more nuanced with a large number of supporters for both governments around the world if I remember correctly. Whereas the Myanmar Military id universally viewed as evil around the world. UN fact finding missions have found them guilty of genocide on multiple occasions (two different ethnic groups) and committing crimes against humanity. Only reason there's no UN coalition on the ground is because China didn't want to anger the military, as they are currently guarding gas pipelines that run into China, which have been targets for activists, and Russia wants to keep messing money selling them arms, and unfortunately the two countries that benefit the most from this also happen to be two of the biggest seats in the UNSBut yeah, otherwise, these guys are seen as evil around the world and if Starlink could say that one of their first major uses was tookeep democratic activists connected to each other and to the outside world amidst an authoritarian internet blackout by an illegitimate government... Well, I'm pretty sure returning freedom and democracy to a country and preventing further genocide there is certainly one way to win over customers and get the money rolling in."
2265,"Yes, I hope it is true and not some sick joke. It would be great if we got direct comfirmaton from Tesla."
2266,"Maybe, but his involvement, weather fruitful or not, will help spread awareness."
2267,"I'd venture to guess that if he can help, he will.  Starlink is new and this would be excellent advertising.  Helping would likely end up profitable."
2268,"Low cost pr. He is doing great things yet all billionaires are or were assholes. You dong get that kinda money by being a good person. Just imagine the headlines. Elon musk's starlink helps Myanmar overthrow military junta.

Or ""Musk's technology saves Myanmar"" 

An article of this sort

""On the military junta last effort to censorship the Burmese billionaire filantropist, demigod Elon Musk provided resistance protestors with solar roofs power walls and starlink internet free of censorship to open a window to the world. Showing us the brutality of the junta."" 

I mean... You can't get for a couple of sat dishes and few thousand dollars of equipment this kind of press normally. Search puerto rico huracán maria and elon musk he provided some solar panels, enough to take credit. And offer to be the contractor fo the us to rebuild the islands energy grid. (He got the PR but failed the contract)

Possible, yes. Likely, on the fence but not as widespread if yes. Done for the democracy, most likely.. not."
2269,"I don't know, he cares about PR so this might interests him, remember when he called a dude a pedophile because he said his invention wasn't necessary to save the children trapped in a cave?"
2270,Our meme lord to the rescue!
2271,"Even if he won't help, he'll help because thanks to him Myanmar might make it to the headlines and some people may decide to support Burmese, for example by donating to the cause."
2272,"ur not bursting, not for anyone with an ounce of intelligence anyway ! Almost certainly fake. And the US doesn’t decide on another countries internet laws ! I don’t think the current starlink array (1,300 satellites) operationally cover the Myanmar latitudes yet. SpaceX / Starlink is not going to risk it’s [financial] future by getting involved in a coup in Myanmar imo.

2274,"Problem is you need infrastructure. You need the right satellite recievers. However, someone as smart and rich as Elon could figure it out."
2275,I'm sure he'd provide them for free if allowed
2276,What- Myanmar really needs help though. Many people are dying just for protesting peacefully
2277,"Previously, they returned bodies with missing organs, now they do not return bodies."
2278,This military/polices are just pure cancers for our society. They must be eliminated if people want to live peaceful life.
2279,"I wish I can do something for the people of Myanmar, but since I'm a fucking Malaysian Chinese that lives in Malaysia, a country with corrupted government and filled with poverty, all I can do is pray for them. Stay strong people of Myanmar, that's all I can say.."
2280,Fucking sad. What blows my mind is that our (American) military will go to the ends of the earth to steal/claim resources but won’t jump in to stop the atrocities happening in Myanmar right now.
2281,Very sad!
2282,Very sad :(

2286,how sad
2287,Sad and angry. FUCK YOU MAL.
2288,Myanmar has oil.
2289,"It does blow my mind thinking of the tax dollars paid out to private military contractors to terrorize and murder civilians in foreign countries, but when a legitimate reason to fight comes about, not a peep. I wish China or India would step in, here in the US it’s all lobbyist politics and dirty money. It has nothing to do with what’s right and wrong, but the American people are seeing it clearer day by day. There is a great awakening thanks to the internet and freedom of information. It’s also super dangerous as propaganda becomes far more effective using AI and social media. The Burmese out fighting for their freedom are heroes and I hope come country will step up and throw the autocrat dictator pieces of shit on their ass. Any police officers firing on their own people should be haunted by it for the rest of their life, but it’s a hierarchy of bootlicking. As long as they get paid a bit more than everyone else their just fine crushing and oppressing their fellow countrymen. Sad days on planet earth."
2290,"China, India should be ashamed, they are your neighbors, and they are not doing shit"
2291,"Asian countries like china should jump in, America jumping in makes 0 sense...altough any help would be welcome"
2292,"Our military only topples regimes when it's politically convenient for us, not when they're actually evil."
2293,Because Myanmar have no   petroleum. All you Gov care is your country's benefit. You did nothing for pure humanity and democracy.
2294,So true
2295,Yes. I suppose it's a shock to our American friends that their government is not really interested in democracy and fairness - I mean beyond a few million in USAID projects - because internally facing propaganda is in direct contradiction of this reality. To many non-Americans it is not a shock.
2296,"China won’t step in, the more dictators in the world the better it is for them, as it normalises it a little more which they like."
2297,are you serious? they're equally corrupt. many clues pointing to China helping the military. why in the world would you expect them to help?
2298,Ah yes let's have a dictatorship take over from another dictatorship. Brilliant idea
2299,"How ironic. You're attacking me out of the blue for saying China is corrupt and you're here saying the US is doing nothing ""for pure humanity and democracy""."
2300,"I suppose Vietnam alone should’ve woken people up to the fact America isn’t about democracy and freedom, only power for the few and whatever political posturing and wars it will take to keep them filthy rich. The lizard brain, where greed is unquenchable and more is never enough. Without my curiosity and college I would’ve believed the high school propaganda about America, the greatest “super power” bringing freedom and justice to all. It only takes a few conversations with anyone in the military who has served in the Middle East or Vietnam to know it’s all a lie. Once you get into the facts it’s gut wrenching to know the atrocities that have been committed all in the name of “freedom.” Imperialism is alive and well and America is an Oligarchy. I hope the people of Myanmar’s resolute never dies. Soon enough America might look similar to what’s happening there, a dystopian police state, and I would pray the people here would have even half the spirit of the Burmese, though it’s highly unlikely with FB, Twitter and the selfie culture making people believe a protest is mashing the dislike button or coming out with a tiktok video. It’s impressive to see how many people are willing to put it all on the line for a more hopeful future, we could learn something from you all."
2301,"Too many mass killings on their own soil.
They've got immune to it."
2302,"I dont, i know their leaders are corrupted..Im not a fan of china nor india but they can still redeem themelves"
2303,What are the clues? Can you show me? China did not kill a single person in Hong Kong protest. And China never claimed that it belong to a  democracy system. So stop beaming for not getting invole into Myanmar's affair.
2304,Myanmar sent invitations to 47 countries for today’s military parade. Only 2 countries agreed to attend: China and Russia. This can explain everything~
2305,Look it up. China and the Burmese military have a good relationship. Please read my post. I never claimed they killed anyone in the HK protest. I said China is corrupt which is obvious. China is involved in Myanmar's affairs... Just helping the military instead of stopping them.
2306,"And now Isreal is oppressing it's indigenous people.The Palistine people. 
And the world looks on...The western leaders are full of empty words.All have huge stockpiles of weapons.They just sell to mercenary groups.. underhand dealers of death.☠"
2307,"The free world should interfere, it's obvious the ppl in Myanmar do not want the dictatorship of the military but they can't do anything about it in the face of violence and modern weaponry."

2309,It’s despicable to think Americans are taxed so our government officials can be bribed by companies owned by billionaires to build weapons that end up being used only when the same people that profited from producing them want war.
2310,In 2017 the US gave the Myanmar junta 1.5 billion usd. The US gives that much to Israel every single year. They are well involved just supporting the oppressor side.
2311,Makes my blood boil.  10+ people shooting at 1 unarmed.
2312,"I hope the kid is safe and unharmed. Looking at video like this, if trial, all soldiers can’t use excuse of just following the order anymore. This is straight up murder."
2313,i just hope that they accidentally shoot each other
2314,This is terrible.  Why is this only being shared in this subreddit???
2315,Literally hunting people down what the fuck
2316,Cowardly pieces of shit doing what their owner tells them to do. If they would show some courage they could throw Tatmadaw on his corrupt psycho ass.
2317,"This is insane, their people are being hunted like rabbits."
2318,That guy dodged so many bullets. God help those soldiers if they go up against a real army
2319,"Are they real soldiers? Shooting at the person when their own guys are in the background, and one falls right in front of the soldier that just fired his shot LOL."
2320,This is so fucked up and frightening. That poor guy.
2321,"Wow, 10+ trained dudes unable to catch a single unarmed guy, so just cos they have a fat ass they start to shooting him... No respect for human life"

2328,"Looks like the country is heading towards inevitable civil war - unless there is some counter coup inside military \[knowing the brutal nature of Tatmadaw highly unlikely though\]...

How long will these innocent populace be hunted down like that... let the will of the people prevail."
2329,Where is that place?
2330,Fuck :(
2331,How are the military soldiers of Myanmar so brainwashed? Surely it has to be something more?
2332,"So sad, may freedom find a way. And sorry junta jerk wads, but a true soldier is a protector of the people, not the destroyer of it's people. I served in the United States Army as infantry and the way I was trained was that every US citizen was technically my boss and my duty was to keep them safe. THAT is what true honor is. There is no honor in slaughtering your own people."
2333,This is why the 2A exists.
2334,Can I get a quick rundown on the Burmese protestors? What do they want? What are their politics? I come from America where most protestors just do it as a hobby to post pictures on their Insta but this shit looks to be a different level.
2335,[deleted]
2336,"I know, right? They are cowards, not deserving of the title of soldier."
2337,"Very true! It is straight up murder. As a US Army Infantry veteran I can say that every soldier is obligated to follow all **LAWFUL** orders. If a commanding officer were to tell me to fire on my own people, then it would be my duty to relieve that officer and not carry out the order because it is not lawful. Real soldiers do not follow blind orders."
2338,I can't wait to see that footage.
2339,Most of Reddit only pretends to gives a shit about brown people if its anti-China related. Don't for a single second think they actually care about Burmese or Uighur lives.
2340,These guys only dare to shoot unarmed civilian. These cowards will be the first to desert if they go into battle with Ethic armed groups in country's side.
2341,No I hope he doesn’t help them. They fight for something disgusting
2342,"Based on the fact that they are actively massacring people, I don’t think intelligence is one of their strengths"
2343,you are talking about a bunch of less-than-animals there...... just hope they do it more so they end up killing each other for real
2344,This is footage. Send it to journalists in the US

2347,yeah i got news for you buddy...
2348,"Yeah in case that happens though, I'm sure we will win. Our EAOs will unite and those in the Tatmadaw that are already looking to desert will desert en masse."
2349,"It can be Monywa or Pago
Someone pls confirm the place"
2350,Heard  it was somewhere in shan state.
2351,They'd rather wear the boot then being kicked by it
2352,Stop bringing American politics into this. This isn’t about you
2353,"Too many protestors, journalist, and bystanders have been injured, jailed, and killed in America for you to just dismiss them by saying most of them are doing it as a hobby."
2354,These guys are definitely not soldiers. They are armed thugs.
2355,"Yup I agree, this is how two totally different military's established to operate. Unfortunately Myanmar soldiers attitude are barbarically downgraded into animal level. They were taught to just follow an order from above. That's all they know and they'd never follow rules of Geneva convention. If you are abducted at night or captured alive, there is a high probability you will never return home alive."
2356,Some soldiers have fled to Thailand who refused to fire on their own people
2357,"You coming to help?

Five years ago I was asked to help train and I said no.

I deeply regret that now.

I am not making the same mistake twice. I call this region home. I think you should stay in America and never claim any other identity if you don’t have it in yourself to directly help during these times. I would be forever ashamed of myself if I didn’t directly help my friends during this time."
2358,Holy shit you are a loser
2359,That's true lol. So many deserters in Kachin and Kayin state loool
2360,👍

2366,Sad powerful picture
2367,"My heart and condolences go out to all those brave humans.
I keep wishing for peace but it conflicts with power."
2368,I hope that the military junta responsible for killing Myanmar since February ought to be sent back to Hell.
2369,uncharacteristically inappropriate but true....
2370,If only the worker were armed and not just the military pigs.
2371,Thanks for your support.Many real things are saddening.
2372,We don’t want to live even one more second under this regime.
2373,Both COVID-19 & military are China-Sponsored😑
2374,Any year can get worse
2375,"No, they can’t. The more they oppress us, the harder we will fight back."
2376,Normal people are the biggest and most powerful force on the planet. Just got to get organised.

2381,These military hounds only worship to military might.
2382,"We see you, and we support you. Nobody should be living this way."
2383,I understand you. I hate what is happening now.
2384,"Yes, CCP not the people"
2385,Very true. No brutality will ever be enough to keep the people scared.
2386,Exactly and they never want to serve the workers so they took away all the worker's guns.
2387,I appreciate your support.We want to wake up from this nightmare.

2393,Adorable 🥰
2394,I had no idea people started training to become Buddhist monks so young?
2395,Is that aang the last Airbender
2396,"He is cute, but I feel like he should not have been there. I know that houses are not 100% safe anymore, but they are still safer than outside during protests."
2397,"Uhh... I might get downvoted for saying this but no matter the cause I think small ones should be left out of politics.

On the other hand, you don't need to be grown up to recognise the bad guys if they come to your home and harm your loved ones."
2398,Can someone explain to me the three finger salute please?
2399,such a bittersweet photo
2400,Even kids knows how bad they are
2401,"Indoctrination of children into religion can never be moral.  

What you're looking at is a child that will never own anything because of their religion.  They won't have their own house.  They won't have their own food.  They will live off the generosity of others, asking for food handouts as their religion demands of them.  

Buddhist monks are celibate for life.  He'll never know sex or intimacy because of religion.

All religions have major drawbacks, even buddhism.  Hey, if you want to live that life that's fine.  Go do it.  Don't force little kids into believing fictional, unproven things as if they were real without giving them any proof.  Don't force them into religious lives.  Let them choose, when they're an adult, if that's what they want.  

You see a cute little kid.  I see a life that's already been ruined by religion.  Like some sort of zombie child that only gets to live a part of human life.  

""Oh, but he's smiling and looks happy!"".

Sure.  He got his little cooked rice or potato cake for the day.  There's nothing else on the plate, never was.  That's not just a meal.  That's the same class meal he'll have for the rest of his life.  While he sits barefoot on a curb / stair after seeking 'enlightenment' all day playing a little drum.  Like he does every day.  Until he's dead.

No wife/kids & job + education and house. 

No apartment + dog & roommate and friends.

You've been indoctrinated into a religion.  You walk the streets looking for handouts.  Sometimes you say little prayers.  That's all you ever do."
2402,This boy is adorable.
2403,Many Buddhist people in Myanmar join the sangha temporarily for temporary periods throughout adolescence and adulthood in order to learn about Buddhism and earn merit and then return to their normal lives afterwards. It's kind of like Christian summer camp.
2404,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-finger_salute_(pro-democracy)
2405,"In Myanmar, becoming a monk or nun is often not permanent. It is done by many people for temporary stints to earn merit. You will see kids going to monasteries for a few weeks to study and learn and practice Buddhism and then they return to their normal lives - kind of like Christian summer camp. I have friends who are married with kids who have been monks 3 or 4 times during their lives."

2441,"As an American, I am so sickened by the lack of spine from the west. Your condemnations mean nothing. Our values are just bullshit if we don't take action, real action, in situations like this. It's useless rhetoric. I fear the only chance for Myanmar is in the hands of the people of Myanmar. It's a shame you are not sitting on a giant ass oil field... then we could be watching something like ""Operation Tropic Shield"" and hear speeches about how we must protect Myanmar's liberty. Sorry Myanmar, I wish we actually stood up for the values we claim we cherish and had some actual backbone."

If we have one hundred or even a couple of thousands of people like him, their efforts will pay off.

We are talking about hundreds if not  thousands of families and people being displaced from their homes and provinces as the war goes on.

Original comment

This post is getting attention in this sub. I just want to tell anyone who is sorting by hot that the situation this Saturday (March 27th, 2021) is pretty bad right now. Almost all major cities are being shot at and the death count was 20 this noon.

It is likely we will see more deaths. There are many videos and photos being shared on Twitter now. Much of them can be seen if you sort by news of this subreddit.

If anyone from within the country is seeing this, I urge you to be as safe as possible. It's disgraceful that the army celebrates Armed Force Day by killing many people across many different cities."

I’m sure with enough research their families could be found as well."

Maybe we should just do nothing you suggest.. bahhh 🐑
2617,I know. I do what I can to spread the news about the situation. I asked what was happening on the video.

2619,"Always that one guy making the America comparison. Stop. Yes, the US has a lot of problems. It may be the time but this is not the place for it. This is about Myanmar."
2620,Thank you for the clarification.
2621,"Since when is Myanmar a superpower? There's a very obvious difference between intervening in World Wars where there is a very clear and real threat of global expansion, and military intervention in problems contained in specific countries all over the world. 

>You don’t think we should have gotten Saddam Hussain?

No, neither does anyone who has any comprehension of the effects that invading Iraq and Afghanistan have had. Suggest you do some reading on what led to 9/11 in the first place, or the effect that US intervention has had on countless countries over the last 70 years. 

>You think this would still be America today or communist Germany...???

*This* is the internet. Not everyone on Reddit is American or clueless enough to believe in the world police bullshit. 

>You don’t think life is worth saving??

What's your plan then, flying over to Myanmar and asking them politely? Are you genuinely this naive? How many dead civilians does the US and its allies have on their hands from ""saving lives"" in every corner of the globe over the last several decades? I promise you the deaths in Myanmar wouldn't even register against that figure."

George floyd got his neck kneeled on for how long??? Cops executed a no knock warrant and killed breanna taylor, shot Jacob Blake 7 times I can go on and on but you just rather ignore the fact that it's true I never once said the myanmar military was like the American police force either I said that the comment of how they detained him for no reason, and beat him is like what the american cops do."

2629,"As an American, I know we have a terrible, corrupt justice system. Right now though, on this post, we are focusing on the very many atrocities being committed by the military in Mayanmar. They are in a complete police state right now. Too many people are being killed, tortured, and kidnapped. Hundreds of families are mourning the losses of their loved ones. Paramedics are being beaten and killed for helping any civilians. 

Yes, we do have issues, but Mayanmar needs way more attention than we do. They need our help and support."

2678,"Actually I haven't asked anyone here to send me money... Concerned individuals in my actual community are able to reach out to me if they wish.  

I have doubts my explaining this to you any further will change your mind as it seems you never entered this thread to learn anything new.  However, in the event things were still not clear to you, here is a final summary:

Civilians in Myanmar are participating in CDM to pressure the military.  This is a powerful protest tool but it can be hampered by people having to stop due to lack of funds.  Expats and other concerned international persons are encouraged to help by donating to CDMs.  It is difficult to transfer money individually if you are an outsider, therefore people who do have a trusted contact have volunteered to collect the funds and transfer them.  It's the same idea as if an office colleague was collecting money in an office drive to gift to another sick colleague in hospital - its to simplify the collection and delivery and not to take a cut.  

It's unfortunate if you don't understand this, or have never had the opportunity to witness people working honestly and selflessly for others.  I hope that changes for you."
2679,"The brutal truth is, at the end of the day, ALL countries behave in the best interest it’s own regardless whether it’s western democratic countries or your neighbour China. UN itself means absolutely nothing without its major player’s support."

2682,"At this rate, the UN will get heart disease by feeling concerns over Myanmar."
2683,Lmao people in my country think its racist to interfere and “thats the uns job”. Sorry to say but the un does jack shit and with a military as big as ours we should at least use it to defend human rights.
2684,Just Firmly Concerned But Never take Action.
2685,The UN is and has been a worthless organization for quite a while.
2686,True AF
2687,"What should the UN do?  I think there’s this fundamental misunderstanding of what the UN does.  Its purpose is to stop large wars from happening.  Its purpose is not really to stop bad things from happening within countries, though it has tried to do that in the past obviously.  The structure of the UN and the tools it has actually makes it very successful in preventative matters but pretty useless in prescriptive matters"
2688,The same people who were complicit when the ASSK and the fascists were so keen to keep the UN out for the last decade do not get to complain about their capability.
2689,"It's basically a hated if you do, hated if you don't situation for them.

At this point military intervention/arming the ""rebels"" would be the only thing to stop the junta. But if the UN or a western nation task force does intervene they will get the same shit they have gotten for years for being the ""world police"" by those opposed to foreign intervention. If they don't then they will get shit for just using words/ economic sanctions by those that want intervention.

Just using words and sanctions are cheaper so until chemicals weapons are used or a huge massacre is showed on western news no intervention will happen."
2690,Well now you know what the Rohingya went through. In fact what they went through was worse. The entire country supported the genocide. No one came to their defence. The UN at least helped them while they were in Bangladesh.
2691,"Majority of the Burmese people does not understand that concept. 

They also don't understand that ASEAN cannot do much either."
2692,This comic makes it look like the UN is supposed to retrieve drowning people but they're actually just there to stop the boats from bumping into eachother.
2693,Leave that for the Rohingyas to criticize UN's capability. UN failed to intervene in a 21st century genocide even after Bosnia and Rwanda.
2694,"try walking in our shoes. we would want all the help we can get.

we're mainly bashing on UN because they can send an arms embargo but they won't."
2695,They'll never do that as long as China and Russia keep selling arms to the Tatmadaw. The UN is not meant to deal with internal affairs. It is a body that facilitates diplomacy between sovereign states. The veto nations on the security council have veto power to prevent each other from meddling within their sphere of influence. It may seem useless but brcause of this veto power nations have not started WW3.
2696,"They can't and they won't as long as countries like China and Russia does not agrees to it. 

Burmese are not only bashing UN as you claimed but also ASEAN. 

About a month ago, both the Thai and Indonesian ministers initiated a meeting with a representative from the Tatmadaw and your people flamed and scolded these 2 ASEAN Ministers for talking to the representative of the Tatmadaw, saying that ASEAN don't respect your votes, etc.

At the same time, your people keep ASEAN for help and even to the extent of deployment of ASEAN troops. Look at the posts on CNA. 

Now ASEAN initiated a meeting with the Tatmadaw in Jakarta and your people again flamed and scold ASEAN for not inviting your NUG. The ones holding the power as well as not only having the guns, bullets and tanks but also doing the killings are the Tatmadaw regardless if they are the legitimate or illegitimate Govt of Myanmar. 

ASEAN do or don't do anything, also get flamed and scolded. Your people are really hard to please. 

Take a look at historic revolutions and uprisings in the past, did they have foreign intervention? 

Look at your own history. Did any foreign intervention came in 88 or 07.

Deep down you and I know the answers well but either your people are too irrational or too emotional to see the cold hard facts.

You asked others to try walking in your shoes. Have your tried walking in other people's (UN, ASEAN, etc) shoes as well?"

2698,"What I am basically saying is that no foreign help in the mode of military action is coming.

They have a right to ask for help. But other nations also has the right not to send their troops into Myanmar to fight their military. 

Some Burmese begs, plead and even demand for help but when the help isn't coming, the same Burmese resort to flame and scold the other nations or organisations. 

Burmese people either have to live on their knees under military rule or stand up on their own 2 feet, fight, bleed and even die for their own cause. The choice is theirs.

No one is going to fight their war for them especially in this worldwide pandemic."

I also want to note that proving to yourself and the world that you are not afraid of anything is a bad attitude, which can lead to trouble for you and your friends. It is okay to have fear. In fact, it is a rare anomaly when someone has no fear. When you control your fear, fear protects and helps you, fear as a friend advises when the risk is too great, but when fear controls you, it paralyzes you and the result may even kill you."

Stop blaming others like UN, ASEAN, US, etc. for not helping. It's your country. Take responsibility. There are countries from equal or worse circumstances who've done better.

If millions of Bamar cannot create an armed resistance in this day and age while ethnic minorities have tried for the past 70 years and succeeded to some extent, you guys are useless

Pity! It was wrong for Myanmar people to think they will come to rescue for being peaceful. We already know they are useless. 

And you, don’t criticise people of Myanmar when you have never experienced such atrocities, unless you can offer a kind word to them. Like I said, we are done hoping the democratic world will come into our rescue."

If you're going to die for revolution anyways, die in battle rather than in protest."
2768,"Ooooh her will (scary). Her three finger accomplished absolutely nothing. Meanwhile us ethnics have fought in battle, died, and funded arms for the past 70 years while the Bamar were blaming us for causing disunity and denying the treatment military gave us.

Lie to yourselves all you want."

You want to be brave. Then fight back. That's real courage. Otherwise you are just cowards hiding behind symbolic gesturing presented as bravery.

2770,That's a stupid argument. Doesn't disprove my point in any way. I bet you I have more family who's died in actual battle fighting Tatmadaw than you. Not to mention I've donated thousands to KIA over the years. Wtf have you done?

2772,"To show the defiance despite ongoing savage oppression from Military Junta. Giving hope to the people who saw her brave gesture.

2773,She inspired. Look at how much you feel even in opposition to it
2774,"You are right. She and others like her, are just showing their defiance despite the obvious risks."
2775,"I can't understand why you are mocking her action.

What is it that you are blaming at? Do you think they are coward cause they protest peacefully so they can get nothing with their protest? Then what do you think about the sacrifice of over 750 and over 4,000 of 8888? Is it less than your sacrifice of ethnic armored? They are risking their lives coz they can be shot any time, any where on the street. You have your armor to protect you at least. They just throw their bare bodies on the bullets. But I don't want blame you coz it's your belief and mind.   
Do you think they can get nothing from their peaceful protest? I don't think so.  
At least they get achieved more than you. Do you think you can get change or progress in this protest without support of normal citizen? I believe you may get no progress in this battle without their support and change of mind. In every revolution, citizens will make the historical progress, not the small armored activity.  
Than what do you want? Do you want citizens' acceptance of junta? No? Maybe No. Than do you insist every protesters should join ethnic army? Do you have enough armors to arm and foods to feed them? 

Do you believe your mocking will make more citizens to join armored ethnic army?  
If you are leaders of ethnic army and your understanding of current protest is like this, I will not join you for common fight.

Second. Are you insisting you will not unite with Barmar coz they oppress and disunite you historically? Don't you want unification by historical cause? I heard some Barmar's saying sorry about history and want to unite with you. So what do you want? Disunification? I don't believe you want disunification cause you can get nothing(no progress) with this? Then What? Do you insist real unification is joining ethnic army? I don't think so. I believe unification  is their will, mind and spirit for unification of them. I think you can insist they can win by young protester's joining ethnic army but you don't deserve to blame and mock peaceful protesters. 

I believe there's many battle fields in current protest like armored struggle, street protest, ethnic unification, progress of citizen's consciousness, global interests, internal consciousness change in junta terrorists.  I believe we can win by winning in this all battle fields. And I believe you need to do your best in your position and cheer up all other participants of other battle fields who are fighting against terrorist junta together with you.

I want to say again they are not your enemy but your colleague."
2776,Bravery isn’t defined by just getting out and fight back with arms. It comes in several forms. Only if you knew. And only if you know how to appreciate it. One kind of bravery did not make another kind any lesser.

Until I am in that position I WILL NOT judge any other person by how they are dealing with terrorism in their own country. 

Like I said, it's easy for you to give advice without having to actually having to put that advice in action."
2779,You supported the disintegration of Burma and India and used innocents as your patsies.
2780,"I could care less what you say as an outsider. Your expertise on this subject is something I have high doubts on. I don't speak like an expert on Korea. Don't preach to be about Myanmar. What arrogance. 

If you're gen Z, I'm older than you and lived in Myanmar through late 0s and 90s. I know more than you. You're all theories and book learned and have no practical experience or understanding of the country you speak of"
2781,"Just because they're both bravery doesn't mean they're of equal degree and cause equal outcomes. What stupidity.

Making symbolic gesturing pales in comparison to battle in both bravery and effect. You're comparing theatrics to direct conflict.

I'm sure the military is so frightened and will change because you held up three fingers like in Hunger Games. Ooooh (scary)"
2782,"Oh yes, Im racist because I explain I understand the ugly side of Myanmar more since Im Kachin minority.

But the millions of Bamar that supported the exclusion of Rohingya at heart and blamed ethnic armies for causing disunity, totally not racist LMAO.

If Rohingya explained the genocide they faced, you probably say they're racist Rohingya.

Talk about gaslighting"
2783,"I CAN judge because I have been in that position. I'm from Myitkyina. So shut up. You yourself are judging me while preaching about being nonjudgemental, you hypocrite"
2784,"What are you talking about? Man, your country is turning into North Korea. You're enjoying internet for the last time of your life. Stop talking about Bangladesh and fix your country XD"
2785,"It's not the matter of nationality or where I live in. It's the matter of right or wrong. I admit that you may know about current situation, background and history of myanmar. Then you just need to say what you want to insist with your knowledge of that and show your reason why you are insisting of that. Maybe you may have more knowledge about current situation and background, your attempt seems very impure to me. To me, your comment seems just pointing and blaming colleagues to disunite protesters and citizens. Although I'm not the citizen of Myanmar, I know the solidarity is one of the most important element of current protest."
2786,"If I analyze your opinion extremely to the end, you are insisting the all activities of global citizen's support is for nothing coz they are not fighting face to face with terrorist junta with armors. Same as all CDMers and peaceful protesters. You should accept that face to face armored fight with terrorist is not the only battle field of this protest."
2787,"I don’t think you can process the idea of how different kind of defiance could come together and attribute to the common cause. People have different level of ability to get involved and do their best. These can come together and become a massive force.

The kind of bravery someone mustered does not need to be same nor of equal value to another. One could be dependent on another. Imagine all the civilian don’t show any sort of resistance, either big or small, just a small population takes arms and fight (because obviously not everybody can fight), do you think they will win? I don’t think so. 

Take Kachin, as we know they have been in fighting with arms alone. How long has it been? For like 70 years? Why? Because taking arms alone can’t fight back mate. You need people support. 

What about civilian who just keep defying the authority without support from arm resistance? Will they last long? Hell no! So don’t be close minded and I hope you see the bigger picture. 

This will be my last reply. You are just one sided, insulting and unappreciated person. You are just wasting my time."
2788,"I have much respect for all the Kachin. That is not including you because I don't think you are Kachin. I think you are an outsider who is pretending to be Kachin and spreading hate speech deliberately on this sub.

To improve your faking, check these Kachin news outlets to see the real Kachins who are fighting for the cause.

As for Burmese fixing their country, defying the junta is how they start to fix it.  

What they don’t start to do is listen to your divisive BS.  

What I am talking about is that Bangladesh has been sending streams of refugees into its neighbors and those refugees have been active in secessionist movements."

By your logic, I think you're just a foreigner posing as a fake Myanmar like u/iranisculpable.

And two of my uncles were killed in battle in the 90s from both sides of my family and my mother's uncle has been in prison for years now. The reason I can even speak English is because my family had to flee for their safety to another country while you Bamars were enjoying yourselves and blaming us ethnics for causing disunity.

Your opinion matter less to me than you think, because you're all talk while my family has actually paid in blood. Go f yourself and your aloo. Go pat yourselves for your mediocre symbolic gesturing"

You call others racists, yet you are the only one here painting an entire race with your accusations. Yes, you can be Kachin and still be a racist. Racism is not limited to a single race. Of course people who are actually not racist would understand this simple fact.

You're getting a temp ban because all your replies are more inflammatory/incivil rather than a point of discussion (here and basically in every other post on this sub). Keep it up and you can enjoy taking your wisdom elsewhere.

2815,"15 distinct massacres of Marma people who are of a different religion. And the Hindu massacres by Bengali speakers in Burma. These aren't isolated singular case but 16 distinct events over decades speaks to a pattern. I'm sure with further digging there will be more. THAT is called a pattern of brutality against others not muslim in this particular region.  

Edit: after doing a brief 1 minute search, here are the [massacres in Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Bangladesh), most of them religion-motivated, much against Hindus, some against Buddhists. There was one particularly ugly one called [Genocide of 1971 against Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide). There is a repeated pattern in Bangladesh of genocide."

2817,"When will you talk about the killings of Indian Muslims and Kashmiri muslims in India by extremist Hindus such as Rss, Bajrang dal, and Shiv sena? Oh wait that probably doesn't suit your agenda doesn't it? The military Junta doesn't discriminate and has killed and raided Hindus in Burma but you seem to only worry about hindus while not giving a fuck about other ethnic minorities. India also persecutes and has killed many Indian Muslims and looted their shops and homes but you're not ready for that conversation."

The military/government from what i understand was very restrictive with things like firearm licenses, and 3. Their is still some hope the international community will respond as the slaughter becomes to great to ignore. By continuing to protest peacefully they don't look like rebels. It's pretty dumb because if a close nation provided arms to the local population they would be viewed as an armed rebel group compared to NATO/UN occupying the country."

Well, within 30 minutes you can

* Share this instruction with your friends, see what is happening in Myanmar right now, and send some of the news in popular subreddits, translate one news into your language and share on social networks or in the local community, and have a coffee.

Or

* Print / draw some flyers and distribute them in the neighboring houses.

Or

* Draw a poster with any title you like and ""#SaveMyanmar"" or ""#HearTheVoiceOfMyanmar"", and go get some fresh air outside.

Just quick title that popped into my head ""Soon we will have TWO North Koreas."""
2866,"It is amazing! Then she sends money to Mutual Aid Myanmar? Or is it used in some other way to raise awareness?
Yes, there are those who care, we just need to quickly find a way to join our ranks.

Do you think flyers are a good idea? I use both social media and flyers, but I can not measure the effectiveness of the flyers."

2908,Does anyone know how to donate to the PDF. A number of groups I know in the U.S want to throw fundraisers.
2909,"In a press conference held in London on 27 August 1969, U Nu announced that he was the 'legal Prime Minister' and 'pledged to the people of Burma' that he would not give up his struggle for democracy in Burma and that Burma was under the 'same kind of fascism' which (Burma's independence hero) 'General Aung San had fought' (during the freedom struggle and the resistance against the Japanese occupation of Burma during the Second World War, including both U Nu and Ne Win as his companions). The full text of U Nu's press conference in London can be read in the 1 September 1969 issues of the Rangoon Guardian and the Working People's Daily. The text of U Nu's press conference announcement, made in English, in London, was also translated into Burmese in full and was published in all the State-controlled Burmese language newspapers of 1 September 1969.[citation needed]

U Nu then used former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Bill Young to help him raise international funding for founding the United National Liberation Front (UNLF). By the end of 1970, they had garnered more than $2 million.[7]

U Nu later formed the Parliamentary Democracy Party (PDP) and led an armed resistance group. U Nu's 'resistance group' consisted of no more than several hundred or at most a few thousand at its peak and his avowal to fight and overthrow Ne Win from the Thai border met with abject failure. He subsequently accepted an offer of amnesty granted by Ne Win and returned to Burma on 29 July 1980. (The news item that ""former Prime Minister U Nu and wife Mya Yi arrving [sic?] back at Rangoon airport at 3:30 pm in the afternoon of 29 July 1980"" can be read in the 30 July 1980 issues of the Rangoon Guardian and the Working People's Dail"

2930,Where do these military and police sleep at night? Do they have families? What do they think they are fighting for?
2931,yes. nice tactics coming from the safety of your couch
2932,then what would you suggest them to do exactly ?
2933,"That's actually somewhat of a misconception. The Testudo formation is used primarily for sieges and only rarely in field battles. A popular example of this is the Battle of Carrhae, where it was famously ineffective against the combination of Parthian cataphracts and horse archers. The formation was definitely not intended for pitched battle as the main weaknesses were that it was incredibly slow and soldiers within in have an extreme disadvantage fighting in hand-to-hand combat (due to how room to properly maneuver was lacking).

Instead, it's ability to greatly ward off missiles is what makes the formation so great. As you can imagine, its purpose was to defend the soldiers within in so legionaries can slowly (but with extreme safety) be delivered to enemy fortifications.

As such, this is a great formation to use if you aren't necessarily participating in melee but instead focusing on warding off missiles. 

Of course, this is not a true Testudo formation nor their ""shields"" be sufficient enough to protect against bullets. However, I do question the ""armchair general"" philosophy that was purported. If you have any suggestions on how these people can fight better, we will all be interested in hearing it."
2934,Well they are not fighting back for a reason
2935,"The practical nature of a testudo is to protect you and the people next to you against projectiles/missiles, and it's not a smart strategy to use against people who have guns you dumbass"
2936,"Those who are on the ground are fighting back to some degree, with slingshots mostly, and I was proud to be on the line when we forced a full police retreat. We were not as organized as this though. None of us knew each other minutes before, and there were only a few people with shields.

Mostly we were not fighting the police, but just trying to push them back enough so we could continue our march down the planned route keeping them far away from an intersection where we would turn, so that they could not reach the intersection with tear gas. A lot of attention was focused on neutralizing tear gas.

Besides the threat to protestors, some who are elderly themselves, its been getting into crowded apartments above the narrow streets where older people who have respiratory problems are now suffering. Many are poor and have no a/c and it is unbearable to close the windows this time of year of you don't have a/c.

But I understand your frustration with us not being more offensive. People are getting shot in the head by snipers for just marching in the road. Marching in the streets, that alone won't accomplish much. There is much I would like to do, but as a foreigner, I stand out and would be easily tracked down. I wish I could meet with these guys and discuss strategy, but I have not seen anything this organized yet. That said, I don't venture out into the streets often because of medical issues."
2937,"Anything over like 15mm is gonna stop a pistol round, but as someone else said spalling is just as dangerous as bullets, spalling being the fragments of bullet that fly in every direction when it hits the shield"
2938,"Depends on the quality of the steel, but you gotta beware of spalling too. That can seriously injure you even if the bullet is stopped."
2939,"There is a multiple-generations worth of propaganda that makes people think going against the military is doomed so it's just better to follow their orders. Such people will always come out with excuses to justify those actions. Of course, not everyone takes this bullshit but the military (who also owns the police force) had selectively chosen those who will and armed them."

3124,"Belarus is in the midst of sporadic periods of civil unrest, followed by brutal unrest. This has largely died down in the last few months, but could flare up again as weather improves into and throughout the summer. 

The Hong Kong civil disobedience movement hasnt stopped in over 2 years, though it has largely died down from its original momentum. 

Russians are beginning weekend protests against the kremlin and Putin for their treatment of the main opposition party's figurehead Alexei Navalny's in the legal system, and subsequent jailing, which has further led to Navalny seeing serious health deterioration. Navalny was also as victim of a previous assassination attempt by the kremlin, in the UK.

India's Farmer protests are still ongoing, though the current Covid-19 situation in the country has heavily impacted protests.

How brain washed can you be!!
3129,"I am pretty sure the army blamed in on protesters as they did with the girl from Mdy.

As a soldier, he will eat the propaganda spoonfed into his mouth, and side with his father's murderer, the army. I didn't see a guy from the army has any gust to stand on the side of the truth.

3142,"Please bear with me.... I’m trying to better understand what’s happening in Myanmar. 

It was a few days or a week after America’s Nov 3rd election, I heard a brief news story about Myanmar holding elections, and that many of the citizens believed the elections were fraudulent, so the military took over everything until they cold hold another election after rooting out the corruption. 

Within 24 hours of hearing that news story of the Myanmar military taking over the government, I then see a report that the Biden administration puts huge sanctions on Myanmar to punish the military for conducting a coup. 

You can see how confusing this is to an outsider....

Were the elections actually fraudulent, and the military did their best to stop the fraud? 

Who was the winning and losing party in the election? 

And which side did/does Biden’s administration support?"
3143,Fucking trash
3144,Unless i read it wrong he should be a captain. Since Myanmar Army use stars instead of bars as insignia for low level officer. But still 20yo captain
3145,"I believe that 3 stars is Captain.

Yes, he's still very young.

Then again, myanmar army is like low value currency exchange rate. Look at how a lot of the soldiers handle their weapons.

Btw, what did the last photo says?"
3146,Which rank do they normally obtain after finishing DSA?

Infantry on the other hand had to actively fight the civil war with the Karens in the north. Whenever they survive a deployment they get promoted. The death toll there is pretty high though around 80-90%. Takes less than a year to rank up."
3161,Lol good one
3162,I think it's his hands and feet.
3163,The man works at shwe Dagon. apparently he didn’t let soldiers in or smth and didn’t give the keys so they killed him
3164,"With the corruption rampant in Myanmar, do you actually think he got his rank fairly?"
3165,"He is not Lieutenant General, but a Captain. I can see the rank and tell."
3166,"It means ""Dad""."
3167,"Of course, he is a Captain. 

&#x200B;

OP just inflate ranks a lot."
3168,"Infantry always gets promoted the quickest in myanmar military. Everyone starts out at 2LT after ocs and takes them 3-4 years to go up 1 rank as they mostly do office work and routine training. 

Infantry on the other hand had to actively fight the civil war with the Karens in the north. Whenever they survive a deployment they get promoted. The death toll there is pretty high though around 80-90%. Takes less than a year to rank up.

I'm not sure about now but people used to joined the military once they finished their 10th grade at age 16-17 since myanmar public schools did not have a 12 year system previously. Basically if you passed your O level equivalent you qualify for ocs. If you flunked u start out as a corporal. If your education level never reached 10th grade you start out as a private."
3169,"They have got 1 star, second Lieutenant after Graduated from DSA. And they will get another star to Lieutenant after a year, and another star after 3 years and become Captain like that Kid in the photo.

Even if those military forces wipe out 90% of their civilian population, nothing will change.

They go at night, because army are now knowing the risks of negative reports.
I am sure governments are watching them very closely now. I wish them them

Burmese are known for their kindness.
Good will prevail."

3208,"The uniform soldiers would shoot unarmed civilian protesters then post videos on TikTok to brag about how tough they are and how people run like dogs. Some show off their guns and threaten people about how they are going to kill civilians at night fall since the military imposed curfew and only the soldiers are allowed to roam at night. Also, There are posts about arresting young female protesters so they can rape them. Most of their kills are Buddhists so all types of things to scare people into submission. I wonder how these soldiers would respond if people they are facing aren’t young students but trained professionals like you that can cause real harm. Out of curiosity, How does the contracting job play out? Who funds it?"
3209,We need figure out a way to send them some 3d printers and pipe stock.
3210,"I reckon it wouldn't take much armed force to topple this ""*military*"". A lot of the soldiers are insufficiently trained, physically unfit and have poor tactical skills."

3212,"American veterans have been massacring Muslims for years, too. I think American veterans shouldn't speak after you destabilized the whole Middle East and Southern America."

Wonder how that medal looks like."
3214,I feel the same way brah
3215,They(Myanmar military and police) are killing us instead of protecting us😭

3222,"That’s fucking dark. They don’t see them as people, that’s the only way to justify that sort of behavior. Killing and raping. 

There’s different types of assholes. There are the regular assholes that are fucking with people doing menial work like patrolling streets, or cooking. Necessary for an army, don’t get me wrong. But generally their just feared because they have numbers and weapons. These guys either run or give themselves up. There’s rules to killing them anyway, I didn’t write them so go talk to NATO. 

Then there’s some bad mother fuckers, their 1%, that took over everything. The guys that everyone fears. Rolling around in the latest Russian tactical equipment. Because it’s quality gear for a fair price, not some Russia conspiracy. That’s what Egypt did with their stimulus. Then they must have taken over the air support. These assholes are gonna fight to the death, and those are my favorite. Where the infantry motto “follow me” makes sense. Where a bunch of 20 something year old kids run to the sound of the gunfire. Where we get triple stacks of assetts and there’s no rules. I was in some shit once where we had Kiowa’s, fast movers, and drones above us. Circling at different elevations. Fucking Socom budgets man. When they needed a break we had a spectre gunship come on station. 

For a contracting job you submit your resume, go interview and take some physical tests. Get paid enough to get by to train with your team for a bit and then get sent to where ever your assigned. If you want to do gate guard in Kabul Afghanistan I think you’ll make 90k a year. Last I heard anyway. If you want to protect ships and shoot at pirates you might make more than that. If you escort oil company executives through Africa and the Middle East you’ll make more than that. I’ve no shit seen 3 armored Escalades roll through Wardak Provence Afghanistan. There’s 1 fucking road, they stuck out like nothing I’ve ever seen before. For some reason the Taliban didn’t even look at them. There’s literally 2 contract groups in Kyrgyzstan, that are both there own armies. They fought ISIS a few years back, and I’m really not sure how they ended up there to begin with. The stuff exists and they all have their own sort of employment agency here in the states to get the ball rolling. 

The only people with enough money to fund this sort of activity are governments, multi-national companies, especially oil companies, cartels and similar criminal networks. You would be amazed at what get disclosed as aid money, and eventually gets routed into the accounts of these contractors. There’s really no way to keep track of what any single country is doing with their extraordinary stimulus money. We gave Israel something like $5600 a person. Seems like an extreme amount of money for a poor part of the world, that’s currently at war. I might lose you but I’ll come back to this. 

There’s some stories about Russia having a monopoly on natural gas going into Europe, and some other powers wanting to get a new pipeline from the Middle East to Europe to break up the monopoly. Which will cost Russia a fortune. Syria, a couple years back, wasn’t gonna let the pipeline through. So they killed that leader, and attempted to install a new regime. The country fell apart. Side bar-Trump blurted out on National television that our troops were in Syria guarding the oil-end side bar. Because that’s how it was briefed to him. Weird that Russia also in Syria. Their mercenaries attacked an American base over there recently. Maybe 2018. We killed hundreds, dropped bombs on them. It’s was a lot. Keep following the map and you’ll find Israel, and I don’t think their stimulus was a coincidence. 

When Trump was complaining about the pork in the first stimulus bill, once of the things he mentioned was billions going the Egypt, who was going to buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. Why in the fuck would congress be ok with that? Oh right, pipeline into Syria. Get on DuckDuckGo and check out the taliban peace deal for that pipeline. Then check out a map, and while your their try to find the fastest way to get oil to a cargo ship from southern Russia. Here’s a hint, it may or may not be through Afghanistan. 

Trump, as orange and belligerent as he was, did this part right. Having done anything else right, well debatable. There’s no reason for America to continue to be in that war. Thanks to fracking, the United States achieved energy independence. No longer depends on foreign oil. Thanks to the new administrations energy policies, our country is no longer energy independent. Without energy independence we will always have a vested interest in that part of the world. 

To get funded all one of these groups has to do is get a contract through something like the Paris Climate Agreement to protect something of interest. So the American govt doesn’t write these companies a check, the money does eventually get there."
3223,I swear to god if they rape a mf kid i would go ape shit if i had the power
3224,"This is one of the few times where I’d support a militarized intervention.  It’s clear that Myanmar won’t listen to the international community through diplomacy, now is the time to act through brute force."
3225,The American army literally had to start a campaign against fucking up muslims. We called it “hearts and minds.” When you see people as your enemy it’s pretty fucked up what you can justify.
3226,"Your right. There’s different types of assholes. Soldiers from 03-09 were some of the worst types of people. The American military literally had to start a campaign to try and get soldiers to give a fuck about the people in the countries we invaded. It’s a fucked up place to be for both sides. Americans don’t want to be there, and act accordingly. Whoever’s country we decided to invade and overthrow generally don’t like us there. Congress won’t react to this, but if they had something to destabilize international markets they would be all over it. They have made trillions off Afghanistan an the only people who want us there are in the middle of the major metroplexes. Well their equivalent."
3227,That was a very interesting read. Do you think there is a chance for this contractors (the badass ones) to end up in Myanmar and help the civilians agains the military? Also did these guys go to Hong Kong during the protests? Ir maybe there wasn’t an interest there?
3228,The situation right now is already more than enough for you to go apeshit
3229,"The contractors aren’t going to get on line and start firing at the police, but they could be there. I can pretty much guarantee you that in Hong Kong every single security agency in the world had agents on the ground in constant contact with them. Americas CIA kinda specializes in toppling governments as well. They’ve done it several times. They are responsible for a lot of evil in this world. Cartels and cocaine just to name two. They were probably there monitoring key buildings hoping for a break on whatever they were working on. 

If the contractors are there they are following the money. There isn’t much money in protesting. Maybe they are trying to break into a chemistry lab for new synthetic drugs, the virus center in Wuhan, the 5G contractors, Huawei, their military command center, nuclear power factories, who knows. If they want the protest to be successful they can do things like block key roads for military movement, cut off communications for the government, build defensive tools and positions, fund protestors and pay their bills. 

During the riots in Wisconsin here in the states we had actual registered, legal, tax exempt charities taking unsolicited donations and bailing out people who were burning down buildings and destroying peoples property and all sorts of bad stuff like that. Some even went so far as to kill people, and charities with tax breaks were bailing them out. Part of it was government figures, some of it was celebrities, but a lot of it was anonymous. 

I’m not sure what you take over in Myanmar or Hong Kong to make a bunch of money, but that would be a contractors motivation. The various government agencies would all have a different angle. So it’s hard to speculate. 

Just to point out that it exists though, check out the story about the guys being extradited from the US for smuggling the Nissan CEO out of I want to say Japan."

I remember President Bush saying that the West appeased Hitler,but this won't wash,or words to that effect.
Surely it wasn't just about securing it's oil interests?. And I also mean UK as well they know this territory very well.You all got involved in the Balkans crisis. Well,,
This is going to get worse......."
3253,Do they honestly expects the US to intervene by deploying US troops into Myanmar to fight their military?
3254,Nation states are destined to atrophy while the individual will gain newfound independance through the use of technology.
3255,"I wonder what would happen if militias attacked CCPs BRI assets such as the port in Rakhine and the gas pipeline to Yunnan.

3261,This is insane
3262,"During the revolution 0n 8.8.88, there was also no intervention from any foreign nations or the UN. 

It will be likely the same scenario this time round.

If you look at the revolutions like the America Revolution, French Revolution, Cuban Revolution, etc, throughout our history, there is little or no help from a foreign nation."
3263,"What can the US Govt do more except to intervene militarily which is very unlikely to happen.

US and other nations have already imposed sanctions which may or may not affect the Myanmar military adversely.

They have also demand the release of ASSK and other NLD leaders, restore democracy, respect the Burmese people's vote and condemn the Burmese military for using lethal methods against the protesters. All these demands/requests had all fallen on deaf ears."
3264,History did not have access to the microprocessor
3265,"There are sixteen million other things the USA can do, including putting pressure on China and Russia. International politics is 16-D chess and everything affects everything else. If the USA really wanted to intervene, they could - military intervention is NOT the only solution."
3266,"You make it sound so easy and that everything is so simple. 

There will be repercussions and consequences of putting pressure on China and Russia. 

Even if the US could do that and get away with it relatively unscathed, why would they want to risk it and do it for Myanmar?"
